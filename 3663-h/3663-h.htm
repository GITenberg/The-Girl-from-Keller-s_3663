      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE PORTRAIT
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was getting dark when Festing stopped at the edge of a ravine on the
      Saskatchewan prairie. The trail that led up through the leafless birches
      was steep, and he had walked fast since he left his work at the
      half-finished railroad bridge. Besides, he felt thoughtful, for something
      had happened during the visit of a Montreal superintendent engineer that
      had given him a hint. It was not exactly disturbing, because Festing had,
      to some extent, foreseen the line the superintendent would take; but a
      post to which he thought he had a claim had been offered to somebody else.
      The post was not remarkably well paid, but since he was passed over now,
      he would, no doubt, be disappointed when he applied for the next, and it
      was significant that as he stood at the top of the ravine he first looked
      back and then ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the distance, a dull red glow marked the bridge, where the glare of the
      throbbing blast-lamps flickered across a muddy river, swollen by melting
      snow. He heard the ring of the riveters' hammers and the clang of
      flung-down rails. The whistle of a gravel train came faintly across the
      grass, and he knew that for a long distance gangs of men were smoothing
      the roughly graded track.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front, everything was quiet. The pale-green sky was streaked along the
      horizon by a band of smoky red, and the gray prairie rolled into the
      foreground, checkered by clumps of birches and patches of melting snow. In
      one place, the figures of a man and horses moved slowly across the fading
      light; but except for this, the wide landscape was without life and
      desolate. Festing, however, knew it would not long remain a silent waste.
      A change was coming with the railroad; in a few years, the wilderness
      would be covered with wheat; and noisy gasoline tractors would displace
      the plowman's teams. Moreover, a change was coming to him; he felt that he
      had reached the trail fork and now must choose his path.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was thirty years of age and a railroad builder, though he hardly
      thought he had much talent for his profession. Hard work and stubborn
      perseverance had carried him on up to the present, but it looked as if he
      could not go much farther. It was eight years since he began by joining a
      shovel gang, and he felt the lack of scientific training. He might
      continue to fill subordinate posts, but the men who came to the front had
      been taught by famous engineers and held certificates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Festing was ambitious and had abilities that sprang rather from
      character than technical knowledge, and now wondered whether he should
      leave the railroad and join the breakers of virgin soil. He knew something
      about prairie farming and believed that success was largely a matter of
      temperament. One must be able to hold on if one meant to win. Then he
      dismissed the matter for a time, and set off again with a firm and
      vigorous tread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spring had come suddenly, as it does on the high Saskatchewan plains, and
      he was conscious of a strange, bracing but vaguely disturbing quality in
      the keen air. One felt moved to adventure and a longing for something new.
      Men with brain and muscle were needed in the wide, silent land that would
      soon waken to busy life; but one must not give way to romantic impulses.
      Stern experience had taught Festing caution, his views were utilitarian,
      and he distrusted sentiment. Still, looking back on years of strenuous
      effort that aimed at practical objects, he felt that there was something
      he had missed. One must work to live, but perhaps life had more to offer
      than the money one earned by toil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The red glow on the horizon faded and an unbroken arch of dusky blue
      stretched above the plain. He passed a poplar bluff where the dead
      branches cut against the sky. The undergrowth had withered down and the
      wood was very quiet, with the snow-bleached grass growing about its edge,
      but he seemed to feel the pulse of returning life. The damp sod that the
      frost had lately left had a different smell. Then a faint measured
      throbbing came out of the distance, and he knew the beat of wings before a
      harsh, clanging call fell from the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped and watched a crescent of small dark bodies plane down on
      outstretched wings. The black geese were breaking their long journey to
      the marshes by the Arctic Sea; they would rest for a few days in the
      prairie sloos and then push on again. Their harsh clamor had a note of
      unrest and rang through the dark like a trumpet call, stirring the blood.
      The brant and bernicle beat their way North against the roaring winds, and
      man with a different instinct pressed on towards the West.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a rich land that rolled back before him towards the setting sun.
      Birch and poplar bluffs broke the wide expanse; there was good water in
      the winding creeks, a black soil that the wheat plant loved lay beneath
      the sod, and the hollows held shallow lakes that seldom quite dried up.
      Soon the land would be covered with grain; already there were scattered
      patches on which the small homesteaders labored to free themselves from
      debt. For the most part, their means and tools were inadequate, the haul
      to the elevators was long, and many would fall an easy prey to the
      mortgage robber. But things would soon be different; the railroad had
      come. For all that, Festing resolved that he would not be rash. His pay
      was good in the meantime, and he would wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by a cluster of buildings rose out of the grass. A light or two
      twinkled; a frame house, a sod stable, and straw-covered wheat bins that
      looked like huge beehives grew into shape. The homestead was good, as
      homesteads in the back townships went, but Festing knew the land was badly
      worked. Charnock had begun well, with money in the bank, but luck had been
      against him and he had got slack. Indeed this was Charnock's trouble; when
      a job got difficult, he did not stay with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing crossed the fall back-set, where the loam from the frost-split
      clods stuck to his boots, passed the sod stable, noting that one end was
      falling down, and was met on the veranda by Charnock's dogs. They sprang
      upon him with welcoming barks, and pushing through them, he entered the
      untidy living-room. Charnock sat at a table strewn with papers that looked
      like bills, and there was a smear of ink on his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo!" he said. "Sit down and take a smoke while I get through with
      these."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing pulled a chair into his favorite corner by the stove and looked
      about when he had lighted his pipe. The room was comfortless and bare,
      with cracked, board walls, from which beads of resin exuded. A moose head
      hung above a rack of expensive English guns, a piano stood in a corner,
      and lumps of the <i>gumbo</i> soil that lay about the floor had gathered
      among its legs. Greasy supper plates occupied the end of the table, and
      the boards round the stove were blackened by the distillate that dripped
      from the joint where the pipe went through the ceiling. These things were
      significant, particularly the last, since one need not burn green wood,
      which had caused the tarry stain, and the joint could have been made
      tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Festing glanced at Charnock. The latter was a handsome man of about
      Festing's age. He had a high color and an easy smile, but he had, so to
      speak, degenerated since he came to Canada. Festing remembered his
      keenness and careless good-humor when he began to farm, but disappointment
      had blunted the first, though his carelessness remained. He had been
      fastidious, but one now got a hint of a coarse streak and there was
      something about his face that indicated dissipation. Yet Festing admitted
      that he had charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't look happy," he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't feel particularly happy," Charnock replied. "In fact, the
      reckoning I've just made looks very like a notice to quit." He threw
      Festing a paper and swept the others into a drawer. "You might examine the
      calculations and see if they're right. I'm not fond of figures."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was obvious long since. However, if you'll keep quiet for a few
      minutes&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing studied the paper, which contained a rough statement of Charnock's
      affairs. The balance was against him, but Festing thought it might be
      wiped off, or at least pulled down, by economy and well-directed effort.
      The trouble was that Charnock disliked economy, and of late had declined
      to make a fight. Festing doubted if he could be roused, but meant to try.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see an error of a hundred dollars, but that doesn't make much
      difference. Things look pretty bad, but I imagine they could be
      straightened out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long would it take you to put them straight?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three years," said Festing, when he had made a rough calculation. "That
      is, if I got moderately good crops, but I'd cut out drinks, the pool game,
      and some other extravagances. You want to keep away from the settlement."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd cut out all that makes life bearable," Charnock replied, and added
      while his face went hard: "Besides, three years is too long."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing thought he understood. The portrait of an English girl hung on the
      wall behind the stove, and Charnock had already been some time in Canada.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyhow," the latter resumed, "you take much for granted if you count upon
      a moderately good crop; I haven't got one yet. We're told this is a great
      country for the small farmer, and perhaps it is, so long as he escapes a
      dry June, summer hail, rust, and autumn frost. As a matter of fact, I've
      suffered from the lot!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So have others, but they're making good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At a price! They sweat, when it's light long enough, sixteen hours a day,
      deny themselves everything a man can go without, and when the grain is
      sold the storekeeper or implement dealer takes all they get. When the
      fellow's sure of their honesty he carried them on, for the sake of the
      interest, until, if they're unusually lucky, a bonanza crop helps them to
      wipe off the debt. But do you imagine any slave in the old days ever
      worked so hard?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing knitted his brows. He felt that Charnock must be answered, and he
      was not a philosopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Canada's a pretty hard country, and the man without much capital who
      undertakes to break new soil must have nerve. But he has a chance of
      making good, and a few years of self-denial do a man no harm. In fact, I
      expect he's better for it afterwards. A fool can take life easily and do
      himself well while his dollars last."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock smiled sourly. "I've heard something of this kind before! You're
      a Spartan; but suppose we admit that a man might stand the strain, what
      about a woman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That complicates the thing. I suppose you mean an Englishwoman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do. An Englishwoman of the kind you used to know at home, for example.
      Could she live on rancid pork, molasses, and damaged flour? You know the
      stuff the storekeepers supply their debtors. Would you expect a delicately
      brought-up girl to cook for you, and mend and wash your clothes, besides
      making hers? To struggle with chores that never end, and be content, for
      months, with your society?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing pondered. Life on a small prairie farm was certainly hard for a
      woman; for a man it was bracing, although it needed pluck and resolution.
      Festing had both qualities, perhaps in an unusual degree, and his point of
      view was essentially practical. He had grappled with so many difficulties
      that he regarded them as problems to be solved and not troubles to
      complain about. He believed that what was necessary or desirable must be
      done, no matter how hard it was. One considered only the best way of
      removing an obstacle, not the effort of mind and body it cost. Still, he
      could not explain this to Charnock; he was not a moralizer or clever at
      argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then half-consciously he fixed his eyes on the portrait which he had often
      studied when the talk flagged. The girl was young, but there was something
      in the poise of her head that have her an air of distinction. Festing did
      not know if distinction was quite what he meant, but could not think of a
      better term. She looked at one with steady eyes; her gaze was frank and
      fearless, as if she had confidence in herself. Yet it was not an
      aggressive confidence, but rather a calm that sprang from pride&mdash;the
      right kind of pride. In a way, he knew nothing about her, but he was sure
      she would disdain anything that was shabby and mean. He was not a judge of
      beauty, but thought the arch of her brows and the lines of nose and mouth
      were good. She was pretty, but in admitting this one did not go far
      enough. The pleasure he got from studying her picture was his only
      romantic weakness, and he could indulge it safely because if he ever saw
      her it would be when she had married his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curious thing was that she had promised to marry Charnock. Bob was a
      good sort, but he was not on this girl's level, and if she raised him to
      it, would probably feel uncomfortable there. He was slack and took the
      easiest way, while a hint of coarseness had recently got more marked.
      Festing was not fastidious, but he lived with clear-eyed, wiry men who
      could do all that one could expect from flesh and blood. They quarreled
      about their wages and sometimes struck a domineering boss, but they did
      their work, in spite of scorching heat and biting frost. Raging floods,
      snowslides, and rocks that rolled down the mountain side and smashed the
      track never daunted them. Their character had something of the clean
      hardness of finely tempered steel. But Charnock was different.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you think of quitting?" Festing said at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm forced to quit; I'm in too deep to get straight. It's possible that
      the man I owe most money might give me time, but it would only mean that
      I'd slave for another year or two and come down after all. I don't see why
      I should sweat and deny myself for somebody else's benefit, particularly
      as I'm not fond of doing so for my own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you have made a plan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock laughed. "I'd a notion of applying for a railroad job. The pay's
      pretty good, and I daresay you could put me on the track."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could. The trouble is that somebody else might afterwards put you off.
      However, if you'd like to try&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll wait a bit. I don't know that it's prudent to plunge into things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is, if you plunge in and stop in until you struggle out with what you
      want. Come up to the track and ask for me when you decide to let the farm
      go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the whole, I think not," said Charnock, whose look got somewhat
      strained. "You see, I expect an offer of another post though nothing's
      been fixed yet. We'll let the matter drop in the meantime. Are you going
      to the Long Lake picnic?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing looked at him with surprise. "Certainly not! Did you ever know me
      leave my job to go to a picnic?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might be better if you did! My opinion is you think too much about
      your job."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think too little about yours," Festing rejoined. "Anyhow, what
      amusement do you think I'd get from lounging round Long Lake all day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The ducks ought to be plentiful and I'd lend you a gun. In fact, I'll
      lend you my second team, if you'll drive the Marvin girls over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thanks," said Festing firmly. "Somebody left Flora Marvin on my hands
      at the supper, and I imagine she got very tired. She certainly looked
      tired; the girls about the settlement don't hide their feelings. But who's
      going with you, since you want the other team?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I promised to take Sadie Keller."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sadie Keller?" Festing exclaimed and paused, rather awkwardly. "Well, of
      course, I don't see why you shouldn't take her, if she wants to go."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock looked at him with amusement. "As she's the chief organizer of
      the picnic, Sadie does want to go. For that matter, it was her suggestion
      that I should bring you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't be there; for one thing, I'm too busy," Festing declared, and
      soon afterwards got up. "It's time I started back to camp."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the homestead, he walked thoughtfully across the plain. Charnock
      had his faults, but he was his friend and was now in trouble. However, as
      he had not the pluck to face his difficulties, Festing did not see how he
      could help. Then he did not like Bob's taking Miss Keller to the picnic,
      because he had met and thought her dangerous. It was not that she had
      tried to flirt with him, although she had done so; he felt that if he had
      played up, it might have been difficult afterwards to let the matter drop.
      Sadie was not a silly coquette. She had a calculating bent, ambition, and
      a resolute character. She would not flirt with anybody who was, so to
      speak, not worth powder and shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing did not know how Miss Keller rated his value, but he was satisfied
      to remain a bachelor, and had perhaps allowed her to understand this,
      because she had since treated him with cold politeness. Now it looked as
      if she had thrown Bob some favor, which was ominous, because Sadie had
      generally an object. Of course, if Bob were free and content to marry a
      girl from the settlement, Sadie would not be a bad choice. She certainly
      had some virtues. But Bob was not free, and it was unthinkable that a man
      who had won the love of the girl whose portrait Festing knew should be
      satisfied with another of Sadie's type.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Festing pulled himself up. He could not warn Bob to be cautious, or
      interfere with the girl's plans, supposing that she had made some.
      Besides, it was Charnock's affair, not his. By and by he dismissed the
      matter and thought about a troublesome job that must be undertaken in the
      morning.

      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE PICNIC
    </h3>
    <p>
      The picnic at Long Lake was an annual function, held as soon as the
      weather got warm enough, to celebrate the return of spring. Winter is long
      and tedious on the high Western plains, where the frost is often Arctic
      and little work can be done, and after sitting by the red-hot stove
      through the dark, cold months, the inhabitants of the scattered homesteads
      come out with joyful hearts to greet the sunshine. There is, however, no
      slow transition. Rushing winds from the North-west sweep the sky, the snow
      vanishes, and after a week or two, during which the prairie trails are
      impassable, the bleached grass dries and green blades and flowers spring
      from the steaming sod.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, the country round Long Lake has some beauty. To the east, it
      runs back, bare and level, with scarcely a tree to break the vast expanse;
      but to the west low undulations rise to the edge of the next tableland.
      Sandhills mark the summits, but the slopes are checkered with birches and
      poplars, and creeks of clear water flow through the hollows in the shadow
      of thick bluffs. There are many ponds, and here and there a shallow lake
      shines amidst the sweep of grass. The clear air and the distance the view
      commands give the landscape a distinctive charm. One has a sense of space
      and freedom; all the eye rests upon is clean-cut.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bright morning when Charnock drove up to the door of Keller's
      hotel. The street was one-sided, and for the most part of its length,
      small, ship-lap-board houses boldly fronted the prairie. A few had shallow
      verandas that relieved their bareness, but the rest were frankly ugly, and
      in some the front was carried up level with the roof-ridge, giving them a
      harsh squareness of outline. A plank sidewalk, raised a foot or two above
      the ground, ran along the street, where the black soil was torn by wagon
      wheels.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing attractive about the settlement, and Charnock had once
      been repelled by its dreariness. He, however, liked society, and as the
      settlement was the only center of human intercourse, had acquired the
      habit of spending time there that ought to have been devoted to his farm.
      He enjoyed a game of pool, and to sit on the hotel veranda, bantering the
      loungers, was a pleasant change from driving the plow or plodding through
      the dust that rolled about the harrows. For all that, he knitted his brows
      as his light wagon lurched past the Chinese laundry and the poolroom in
      the next block. The place looked mean and shabby in the strong sunlight,
      and, with feelings he had thought dead re-awaking, he was conscious of a
      sharp distaste. There was a choice he must shortly make, and he knew what
      it would cost to take the line that might be forced on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with a certain shrinking he stopped his team in front of the hotel.
      The bare windows were open and the door was hooked back, so that one could
      see into the hall, where a row of tin wash-basins stood on a shelf. Dirty
      towels were scattered about, and the boarded floor was splashed. The
      veranda, on to which the hall opened, was strewn with cigar-ends and burnt
      matches, and occupied by a row of cheap wooden chairs. Above the door was
      painted <i>The Keller House</i>. The grocery in the next block, and the
      poolroom, bore the same owner's name.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Charnock stopped, a man without a coat and with the sleeves of his
      fine white shirt rolled up came out. He as rather an old man and his
      movements were slack; his face was hard, but on the whole expressionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo!" he said. "Late again! The others have pulled out a quarter of an
      hour since."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw them," Charnock answered with a languid hint of meaning. "Didn't
      want to join the procession and thought they might load up my rig if I got
      here on time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keller looked hard at him, as if he understood, and then asked: "Want a
      drink before you start?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thanks," said Charnock, with an effort; and Keller, going to the
      door, shouted: "Sadie!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A girl came out on the veranda. She was a handsome girl, smartly dressed
      in white, with a fashionable hat that had a tall plume. Her hair and eyes
      were black, the latter marked by a rather hard sparkle; her nose was
      prominent and her mouth firm. Her face was colorless, but her skin had the
      clean smoothness of silk. She had a firmly lined, round figure, and her
      manner was easy and confident. Sadie Keller was then twenty-one years of
      age.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you had forgotten to come, Bob," she said with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you were very foolish; you ought to have known me better," Charnock
      replied, and helped her into the wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you do forget things," she resumed as he started the team.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not those I want to remember. Besides, if you really thought I had
      forgotten, you'd have been angry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How d'you know I'm not angry now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock laughed. "When you're angry everybody in the neighborhood knows."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was true. Sadie was young, but there was something imperious about
      her. She had a strong will, and when it was thwarted was subject to fits
      of rage. Reserve was not among her virtues, and Charnock's languid
      carelessness sometimes attracted and sometimes annoyed her. It marked him
      as different from the young men she knew and gave him what she called
      tone, but it had drawbacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me have the reins; I want to drive," she said, and added as the
      horses trotted across the grass beside the torn-up trail: "You keep a
      smart team, but they're too light for much work about the farm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so. Still, you see, I like fast horses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They have to be paid for," Sadie rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true, but I don't want to talk about such matters now. Then I've
      given up trying to make the farm pay. When you find a thing's impossible,
      it's better to let it go."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie did not reply. She meant to talk about this later, but preferred to
      choose her time. Her education had been rudimentary, but she was naturally
      clever. She liked admiration, but was not to be led into foolishness by
      vanity. Sadie knew her value. It had for some time been obvious that a
      number of the young farmers who dealt at the store and frequented the
      hotel did so for her sake, and she was willing to extend her father's
      trade. In fact, she helped to manage both businesses as cleverly as she
      managed the customers. Her charm was largely physical, but she used it
      with caution. One might indulge in banter, and Sadie had a ringing laugh
      that young men liked, but there were limits that few who knew her
      overstepped. One or two had done so, but had been rebuked in a way they
      wished to forget. Sadie had the tricks of an accomplished coquette, but
      something of the heart of a prude.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlement got indistinct, and crossing a low rise, they drove past a
      birch bluff where the twigs were breaking into tiny points of green. Then
      they forded a creek and skirted a shallow lake, from which a flock of
      ducks rose and flew North in a straggling wedge. Sandhills gleamed on the
      ridges, tall cranes stalked about the hollows, and when the team, laboring
      through the loose soil, crossed an elevation one could see the plain roll
      back into the far distance. It was sharp-cut to the horizon; only the
      varying color that changed from soft blue to white and yellow in the
      foreground helped the eye to gage its vast extent. The snow had bleached
      the grass, which glittered like silver in the strong sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      A boisterous wind from the North-west drove white-edged clouds across the
      sky, but the air was soft with a genial warmth that drew earthy smells
      from the drying sod. In places, an emerald flush had begun to spread
      across the withered grass and small flowers like crocuses were pushing
      through. The freshness and hint of returning life reacted on Charnock, and
      stirred his blood when he glanced at his companion. He felt her physical
      allurement as he had not felt it before, but now and then he resolutely
      looked away. Sadie had shown him marked favor, but there was much he might
      lose.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would not have charmed him when he first came to the prairie with
      romantic hopes and vague ambitions. He had been fastidious then, and the
      image of a very different girl occupied his heart. Even now he knew the
      other stood for all that was best in life; for tender romances, and
      sweetness, and high purpose. Helen had gracious qualities he had once
      half-reverently admired. She loved pictures and books and music, and was
      marked by a calm serenity that was very different from Sadie's restless
      force. But it looked as if he had lost her, and Sadie, who could break a
      horse and manage a hotel, was nearer his level. Yet he hesitated; he must
      choose one of two paths, and when he had chosen could not turn back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't talk much," Sadie remarked at length. "Guess you must be
      thinking about your mortgage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was, in a way. It was rather useless and very rude. However, I won't
      think of it again until somebody makes me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a way of yours. You think too late."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I sometimes do so," Charnock admitted. "Anyhow, to-day, I'm
      not going to think at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie noted the reckless humor with which he began to talk, but she led
      him on, and they engaged in cheerful banter until Long Lake began to gleam
      among the woods ahead. Charnock skirted the trees and pulled up where a
      number of picketed teams and rigs stood near the water's edge. Farther
      along, a merry party was gathering wood to build a fire, and Charnock did
      not find Sadie alone again for some hours after he helped her down.
    </p>
    <p>
      In summer, Long Lake has no great beauty and shrinks, leaving a white
      saline crust on its wide margin of sun-baked mud, but it is a picturesque
      stretch of water when the snow melts in spring and the reflections of the
      birches quiver on the smooth belt along its windward edge. Farther out,
      the shadows of flying clouds chase each other across the flashing surface.
      Two or three leaky canoes generally lie among the trees, and in the
      afternoon Charnock dragged one down, and helping Sadie on board, paddled
      up the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they crept round a point flocks of ducks left the water and the air
      throbbed with a beat of wings that gradually died away. The fire, round
      which the others sat, was out of sight, and the rustle of the tossing
      birches emphasized the quietness. Charnock let the canoe drift, and Sadie
      looked up at him from her low seat among the wagon robes he had brought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you going to do about your farm?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know yet, and don't see why I should bore you with my troubles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pshaw!" said Sadie. "You want to put the thing off; but you know you
      can't."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock made a gesture of humorous resignation. "Very well! I expect I
      won't be able to carry on the farm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Sadie, thoughtfully, "I don't think you could. There are men
      who would be able, but not you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare say you're right, but you're not flattering," Charnock rejoined
      with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie gave him a steady look. "Your trouble is you laugh when you ought to
      set your lips and get busy. One has got to hustle in Canada."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have hustled. In fact, it's hustling that has brought me low. If I
      hadn't spent my money trying to break fresh land, I wouldn't have been so
      deep in debt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you'd have had more time to loaf about the settlement?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the whole, I don't think that's kind. If I hadn't come to the
      settlement, I wouldn't have seen you, and that's about the only comfort I
      have left."
    </p>
    <p>
      A touch of color crept into Sadie's face, but her thoughtful look did not
      change.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," she said, "I'd surely have liked you to make good, and don't know
      that we mightn't have got the mortgage held over; but it wouldn't have
      been much use. You'd have started again and then got tired and not have
      stayed with it." She spread out her hands impatiently. "That's the kind of
      man you are!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid it's true," Charnock admitted. "But I hope you like me all the
      same."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie was silent for a few moments, but her color was higher and Charnock
      mused. He supposed she meant she could have persuaded her father to come
      to his help, and it looked as if she well knew his failings. Still he felt
      rather amused than resentful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll let that go," she resumed. "I want you to quit joking and listen.
      We're going to have a boom at the settlement as soon as the railroad's
      opened, and I and the old man can hardly manage the store and hotel. We've
      got to have help; somebody the boys like and we can trust. Well, if you
      took hold the right way&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped, but Charnock understood. Keller was often ill and was getting
      old. He could not carry on his rapidly extending business much longer, and
      Charnock might presently take his place. But this was not all, and he
      hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think I'm fit for the job?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You could do it if you tried."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock smiled. "It's comforting to feel somebody trusts me, and I see
      advantages in the plan. You keep the books, I think. It's very nice in the
      little back office when the lamps are lit and the store is shut. We could
      make up the bills together."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie blushed, and he thought he had not seen her look so attractive. She
      was remarkably pretty, although there was now something about her that
      puzzled him. It was something elusive that acted like a barrier, keeping
      him away. Yet he knew the girl was fond of him; if he wanted her, he had
      but to ask, and it was not on this account he hesitated. He thought of a
      creeper-covered house in England; a house that had an air of quiet
      dignity. He remembered the old silver, the flowers in the shady rooms, and
      the pictures. The girl who moved about the rooms harmonized with her
      surroundings; her voice was low and clear, she had a touch of stateliness.
      Well, he was ruined, and she was far away, but Sadie was close by, waiting
      for him. For a moment he set his lips, and then, while his nerves tingled,
      banished the disturbing doubts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dropping the paddle, he leaned forward, put his hand on the girl's waist,
      and drew her towards him. He felt her yield, and heard her draw a
      fluttering breath. Her head drooped so that he could not see her face; she
      was slipping into his arms, and then, in the moment of surrender, he felt
      her body stiffen. She put her hands on his shoulder and pushed him back;
      the canoe lurched and he had some trouble to prevent a capsize. The water
      splashed against the rocking craft, and Sadie, drawing away, fixed her
      eyes on him. She was breathless, but rather from emotion than effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't do that again!" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock saw she meant it, which was strange. Sadie knew and sometimes
      used her power of attraction, but it was obvious that she was angry. It
      looked as if he had chosen the wrong moment, and he felt worse baffled and
      disappointed than he had thought possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't," he said as carelessly as he could. "You nearly threw us both
      into the water."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess that's what I meant to do," she answered fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I expect I'd have been able to pull you out. Suppose I ought to say
      I'm sorry; but I'm not. In fact, Sadie, I don't quite understand&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she said, "you don't understand at all! That's the trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock took out his tobacco pouch and began to make a cigarette. Sadie's
      cold dignity was something new and he thought she could not keep it up. If
      she did not break out in passionate anger, she would soon come round. As
      he finished the cigarette she turned to him with flashing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put that tobacco away or I'll throw it in the lake! Do you think you can
      kiss me when you like?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I could," said Charnock. "As a matter of fact, I haven't kissed
      you yet. But I'm sorry if you're vexed."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Sadie hesitated and then fixed him with a fierce, scornful
      gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," she said, "you're cheap, and you'd make me as cheap as you! You want
      things for nothing; they must be given, where other men would work and
      fight. But you can't amuse yourself by making love to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock felt humiliated. If he had really offended her, she could have
      rebuked him with a look or sign. Her unnecessary frankness jarred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; I must ask you to forget it. Of course, I was wrong, but I'll
      try not to vex you again. What are we going to do now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Paddle back to the others as quick as you can."
    </p>
    <p>
      Throwing his cigarette into the water, Charnock turned the canoe. It was a
      relief to be energetic, because Sadie's demand for speed stung him. He
      glanced at her now and then, but she gave no sign of relenting; her face
      was whiter than usual and her look was strained. Getting angry, he drove
      the canoe down the lake with a curling wave at her bow, until the paddle
      snapped in a savage stroke and he flung the haft away. For a moment, he
      hoped Sadie would laugh, but she did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now you'll have to paddle with your hands until you pick up the broken
      blade," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock did so and afterwards awkwardly propelled the craft towards the
      camp fire. He thought Sadie might have suggested their landing and walking
      back, but she was silent and calmly watched his clumsy efforts. He was
      glad when they reached the beach where the others were and he helped her
      out. An hour or two later he drove her home, but she did not talk. Her
      anger had gone, but she seemed strangely distant. After helping her down
      at the hotel he waited a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't we make this up and be friends again?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a curious steady glance. "Not now. It looks as if you didn't
      know me yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she left him, and Charnock drove home in a thoughtful mood. He had
      some idea about what she meant and had been rather surprised by the pride
      she had shown. Sadie had certainly led him on; but she was not altogether
      the girl he had thought.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <h3>
      KELLER INTERFERES
    </h3>
    <p>
      For two or three weeks after the picnic Charnock did not meet Sadie. The
      rebuff he had got did not rankle much, and was rather provocative than
      daunting, but he understood why she had told him he made her cheap. She
      meant to keep her caresses for her husband or declared lover, and if he
      wanted her, he must pay the regular price. This was very proper, from her
      point of view, but from his the price was high.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie was pretty, capable, and amusing, but he was not sure he would like
      to see her every day, in his house and at his table. Besides, the house
      would really be hers, and Sadie would not forget this. She was determined
      and liked her own way. He had promised to marry another girl, of a very
      different stamp, but his conscience was clear on that point. It was better
      for Helen's sake that he should give her up, because he was on the edge of
      ruin and she was much too good for him. Irresolution, however, was perhaps
      his greatest failing, and now he must decide, he wavered and thought about
      what he had lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were days when he would not admit that all was lost, and harnessing
      his team in the early morning, drove the gang-plow through the soil until
      the red sunset faded off the plain. In his heart, he knew the fight was
      hopeless; Festing, for example, in his place, might perhaps make good, but
      he had not the stamina for the long struggle. All the same, he worked with
      savage energy until his mood changed and he went off to hunt sandhill
      cranes. He would sooner have gone to the poolroom, but there was a risk of
      his meeting Sadie at the settlement.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime the days got warmer and a flush of vivid green spread
      across the grass. The roaring wind that swept the tableland drove clouds
      that never broke across the dazzling sky, and where there were belts of
      plowed land the harrows clanked across the furrows amidst a haze of
      blowing dust. The ducks and geese had gone, and red lilies began to sway
      above the rolling waves of grass. Farmer and hired man worked with tense
      activity, but Charnock's efforts were spasmodic and often slack.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, trade was brisk at the settlement, and Keller found his
      business made demands on him that he could hardly meet. It was rapidly
      growing, and his strength got less. Indeed, he would have sold out but for
      Sadie. The girl was clever and had tone; he wanted her to find life smooth
      and taste pleasure her mother had not enjoyed. The latter had helped him
      in a hard fight when dollars were very scarce, and died, worn out, just
      before the tide turned. Since then he had schemed and sweated to make her
      child's future safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he thought he had done so, but it had been a struggle, and he knew he
      had held on too long. Keeping store in a wheat-growing district was not a
      simple matter of selling groceries; one was in reality a banker. Bills
      were not often paid until the crop was harvested, farmers began without
      much money, and one must know whom to trust. Indeed, one often financed a
      hustler who had no capital, and kept an honest man who had lost a crop on
      his feet; but the risk was great, and one felt the strain when there was
      rust and autumn frost.
    </p>
    <p>
      One bright afternoon Keller stood on the sidewalk in front of the store.
      He was not old, but his hair was gray and his face was pinched. It was
      rather a hard face, for Keller's glance was keen and his lips were
      generally firmly set. Yet he was liked by his customers. Now he was
      breathing hard because he had helped a farmer to put a heavy bag of flour
      in his wagon. The farmer drove away and a cloud of dust the team stirred
      up blew down the street. The fronts of the wooden houses were cracking in
      the hot sun; there was not a tree to relieve the bare ugliness of the
      place, and the glare was dazzling. Keller at first imagined this was why
      he could not see the wagon well, but after a few moments he knew better.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went into the store with a staggering step, and the rank smell of
      cheese and salt-pork nauseated him. The room felt very hot and was full of
      flies that buzzed in a tormenting cloud round his head. He wanted
      quietness and made his way to the dark back office, where he dropped into
      a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go to the hotel," he ordered the clerk who entered after him. "Tell Jake
      to give you a big glass of the special whisky. Be quick, but don't run and
      spill the stuff."
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk came back in a few minutes, and Keller pulled himself together
      when he had drained the glass, though his forehead was damp with sweat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now where's the list of the truck Gascoyne got?" he said. "I'll look it
      up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure you feel all right?" the clerk inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get the list," said Keller. "Take that glass away."
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked up a pen, but put it down when he found his hand shook, and told
      the clerk to charge the goods. When the latter had gone, he sat still for
      some minutes and then opened a book of accounts. He had had another
      warning, sharper than the last, and had better put things straight while
      he could. With this object he worked later than usual, and when he
      returned to the hotel called Sadie into his private room. The girl sat
      down, and he studied her, leaning his elbow heavily on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie had a strained look and had been quiet for the last week or two
      except when she was angry. This indicated that her nerves were on edge,
      and Keller thought he knew why.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess we've got to have a talk," he said. "I've put it off, but now's
      the time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie waited calmly. She had courage and knew she must be frank with her
      father. He did not, as a rule, say much, but he noted things and
      understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he resumed, "I've built up a pretty good business here, but I'll
      have to quit and leave you some day, and reckon you won't be satisfied to
      stop at the hotel all your life. You're smart and a looker, and I guess
      you want to go out and see the world. That's all right, and you'll be
      able, as far as dollars count; but I can't go with you and you can't go
      alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie shivered. Keller's face was pinched, and she knew his health was not
      good, although she did not know how bad it really was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't leave you, anyway, and hope you'll be with me a long time
      yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's possible," said Keller. "All the same, I can't keep my grip on the
      business long and want a man to help. But I'm not going to trust a
      stranger or a hired man. You see where this leads?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie saw and made a vague gesture, though her glance was level.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. The man who carries on my business must be your husband. Now
      there are three or four of the boys in the settlement who could be taught
      to run the store and hotel, but I allow you don't want me to choose from
      them. Have I got that right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Sadie with quiet calm, although her heart beat. "None of them
      would suit."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keller knitted his brows and his look was grave. "They're good boys, and
      if you had taken one of that bunch, I'd have been satisfied. I reckon the
      trouble is they're my kind and belong where I do, while you mean to go
      higher. Well, that's right; I've put up the dollars to give you a good
      time, but you can't get where you want on your own feet." He paused with a
      dry smile. "I allow you're smart enough to figure this out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have," said Sadie. "There's much I don't know and couldn't learn here.
      If I'm to move up, my husband must help."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I only know two men round the settlement who could help. Festing's
      my choice."
    </p>
    <p>
      A wave of color flushed Sadie's white skin, but her voice was quiet. "He
      isn't mine. I allow, in some ways, he's the better man, but that doesn't
      count."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keller looked hard at her. "I used to think your head would guide you, not
      your heart; but it seems you're like the rest&mdash;well, I was a very
      poor man when your mother married me! Now I like Charnock and he has tone;
      but if you take him, there's a risk&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know the risk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's plain! I'd stop the thing right now if you were a different girl,
      but you know what you want and how to keep it when it's got. It looks as
      if you had made up your mind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie's hands moved nervously. She made a sign of agreement, but did not
      speak, and Keller went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyhow, you'd better understand what you're up against. Sometimes you'll
      have to hustle Charnock and sometimes hold him tight. You must keep him
      off the liquor, and maybe stop him getting after other girls. Then when
      you sell out the business, you'll hold the dollars."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Sadie turned her head and then got up and stood by her
      father's chair. Her look was strained but resolute as she put her hand on
      his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know all that! Bob has plenty of faults, but he's the man I love."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keller took and pressed her hand. He had some misgivings, but he knew his
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We all like Charnock, and though I wouldn't trust him far, I can trust
      you. I think you've got that right and won't forget. Very well, since you
      want Charnock I'll get him for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie stooped and kissed him and then went out. She was moved, but there
      was nothing to be said. Her father was not a sentimentalist, but he had
      never failed her and would not do so now. When she sat down in her room,
      however, her face was grave. Her courage was high, but she felt half
      afraid. Although she loved Bob Charnock, life with him might be difficult.
      He was older than she and knew much more, but she must lead him and be
      firm where he was weak. It was a hard task for an ignorant girl, but she
      resolved to carry it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Keller went down the street and entered a wooden building
      filled with gaudily painted mowers and plows. He was not the man to waste
      time when he had made a plan, and moreover felt that he had not much time
      to lose. Finding the implement dealer in his office, he sat down,
      breathing rather hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't look very spry this morning," the dealer remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't feel so bright. The boys have been rushing me the last week or
      two. Say, trade is booming now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It surely is. I could sell more machines than I've got, but I've got a
      lot of money standing out, and after the bad harvest last fall, don't know
      who to trust."
    </p>
    <p>
      They compared notes about their customers, and presently the dealer
      remarked: "Charnock was in a few days ago, asking about a new wagon, a
      mower, and some small tools."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Keller, rather sharply. "Then it looks as if he meant to hold
      on! He reckoned, not long since, that he'd have to quit. But what did you
      tell him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To come again. I'd like to keep Bob Charnock up, but guess it's
      dangerous. Owes me a pile. How does he stand with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keller supplied the information, and the other looked thoughtful. "Didn't
      know it was quite so bad as that. I allow I'd better not let him have the
      goods."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I reckon he's trying the new man at Concord. Smith said he met him
      there yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      The dealer frowned. He hated to think of a customer going to somebody
      else. In fact, this was, for a debtor, an unpardonable offense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charnock's trouble is that he's not quite straight. Ought to have stayed
      with me, told me how he was fixed, and let me see what I could do. If he's
      going to deal with the new man, I'd better pull him up and try to get my
      money back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't get it," said Keller dryly. "He can't pay now, and if you let
      him go on until harvest, you'll have a crowd of others with long bills
      fighting for what's left."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Looks like that," the dealer agreed. "Well, I'd have liked to keep him
      going if he'd stayed with me, but I can't stand for losing the dollars he
      owes. What are we going to do about the thing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keller explained his plans, and after some argument the other agreed. The
      decision they came to would bring Charnock's farming to an end, but Keller
      left the office with some doubts. His scheme was going to succeed, but he
      wondered whether he had indulged Sadie too far. Much depended on her
      firmness, and she might find the job harder than she thought; but on the
      whole he imagined she would be equal to the strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week later, Charnock sat, one afternoon, in the saddle of his gang-plow,
      tearing a row of furrows through the dusty sod. The sweating horses moved
      leisurely, and he did not urge them as he moodily watched the tangled
      grass part before the shares and vanish beneath the polished surface of
      the turned-up clods. He was breaking new soil, doing work that would be
      paid for in the future, and knew the reward of his labor might never be
      his. When he reached the end of the plowing he stopped and let the horses
      rest while he looked about.
    </p>
    <p>
      One side of the long furrows gleamed in the strong light, and another team
      was moving towards him from the opposite end. The sun was hot, but the
      wind was fresh, and thin clouds of dust blew across the plain. Still the
      belt he was plowing was good soil; the firm black <i>gumbo</i> that holds
      the moisture the wheat plant needs. There was something exhilarating in
      the rushing breeze and glow of light, but Charnock frowned and wondered
      why he had worked so long. He had no real hope, and admitted that he had
      continued his spasmodic efforts because he could not face defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all that, he had not been fighting entirely for his farm. He wanted to
      keep his freedom; to break through trammels that were getting tighter, and
      try to regain something that he had lost. Sometimes he felt desperate, but
      now and then saw an elusive ray of hope. If he could hold out until
      harvest and reap a record crop&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his hired man, driving the other plow, waved his arm, and Charnock
      saw a rig lurch across a rise amidst a cloud of sand. It was the
      mail-carrier going his round, but he would not have come that way unless
      he had letters, and Charnock waited until the man arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's your lot," he said, taking out three or four envelopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock's hand shook as he opened the first, it was large and had an
      official look, and he found a number of unpaid accounts inside. Besides
      these, there was a lawyer's letter, stating that certain dealers had
      instructed him to recover payment of the debts Charnock owed. He crushed
      the letter in his clenched hand and the veins stood out on his forehead,
      while his face got red. The blow he feared had fallen and he was ruined;
      but when the shock began to pass he felt a faint relief. It was something
      to be free from doubt and anxiety, and there were consolations. Now he was
      beaten, the line he must take was plain, and it had some advantages.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can quit plowing and put the teams in the stable," he said to the
      hired man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quit now!" exclaimed the other. "What about the machines?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let them stop," said Charnock. "It seems they belong to my creditors, who
      can look after them. I'm going to Concord and don't know when I'll be
      back."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went off towards the homestead and half an hour later drove away across
      the plain.

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      FESTING COMMITS THEFT
    </h3>
    <p>
      The air was sharp and wonderfully invigorating when Festing stopped for a
      few moments, one evening, outside Charnock's homestead. A row of sandhills
      glimmered faintly against the blue haze in the east, but the western edge
      of the plain ran in a hard black line beneath a blaze of smoky red. It was
      not dark, but the house was shadowy, and Festing noticed a smell of
      burning as he entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The top was off the stove in Charnock's room, and the flame that licked
      about the hole showed that the floor was strewn with torn paper. Charnock
      was busy picking up the pieces, and when he threw a handful into the stove
      a blaze streamed out and the light shone upon the wall. Festing noted that
      the portrait that had hung there had gone, and looking round in search of
      it, saw a piece of the broken frame lying on the stove. It was half burned
      and a thin streak of smoke rose from its glowing end. Festing remarked
      this with a sense of anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you doing, Bob?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cleaning up," Charnock answered, with a hoarse laugh, as he sat down
      among the litter. "Proper thing when you mean to make a fresh start!
      Suppose you take a drink and help."
    </p>
    <p>
      A whisky bottle and a glass stood on the table, and Festing thought
      Charnock had taken some liquor, although he was not drunk. Stooping down,
      he began to pick up the papers, which, for the most part, looked like
      bills. There were, however, a few letters in a woman's hand, and by and by
      he found a bit of riband, a glove, and a locket that seemed to have been
      trampled on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are these to be burned?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Charnock. "Don't want them about to remind me&mdash;&mdash;Burn
      the lot."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing, with some reluctance, threw them into the stove. He was not, as a
      rule, romantic, but it jarred him to see the things destroyed. They had,
      no doubt, once been valued for the giver's sake; dainty hands had touched
      them; the locket had rested on somebody's white skin. They were pledges of
      trust and affection, and he had found them, trampled by Charnock's heavy
      boots, among the dust and rubbish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd get on faster if you used a brush," he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't find the brush. Confounded thing's hidden itself somewhere. Can't
      remember where I put anything to-night. Suppose you don't see a small lace
      handkerchief about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing said he did not, and Charnock made a gesture of resignation.
      "Looks as if I'd burned it with the other truck, but I got that from
      Sadie, and there'll be trouble if she wants to know where it's gone. She
      may want to know some time. Sadie doesn't forget."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did Sadie give you the locket?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She did not," said Charnock. "You're a tactless brute. But there's
      something else I want, and I don't know where it can have got."
    </p>
    <p>
      He upset a chair as he turned over some rubbish near the table, under
      which he presently crawled, while Festing looking about, noted a small
      white square laying half hidden by the stove. Picking it up, he saw it was
      the portrait of the English girl, and resolved with a thrill of
      indignation that Charnock should not burn this. He felt that its
      destruction would be something of an outrage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at Charnock, but the latter's legs alone stuck out from under
      the table, and as it was obvious that he could not see, Festing dusted the
      portrait and put it in his pocket. By and by Charnock crept out and got
      upon his feet. It was dark now, but the glow of the burning paper
      flickered about the room and touched his face. His hair was ruffled, his
      eyes were dull, and his mouth had a slack droop. Festing felt some pity
      for the man, though he was also sensible of scornful impatience. The smell
      of burned paper disturbed him with its hint of vanished romance. Putting
      the lid on the stove, he took the lamp from Charnock's unsteady hand, and,
      when he had lighted it, found a brush and set to work. Presently Charnock
      made a vague sign of relief as he looked at the swept floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All gone!" he remarked. "There was something I couldn't find. Suppose I
      burned it, though I don't remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's nothing left," said Festing, who felt guilty. "Why did you
      destroy the things?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock sat down and awkwardly lighted his pipe. "Wanted to begin again
      with what they call a clean slate. Besides, the stove's the best place for
      bills that bother you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't get rid of the debts by burning the bills."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's true," said Charnock with a grin. "Unfortunately obvious, in fact!
      However, I cut up my account book."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see how that would help."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My creditors can now amuse themselves by finding out how I stand."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing frowned impatiently. "A rather childish trick! It doesn't strike
      me as humorous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a disgustingly serious fellow," Charnock rejoined. "But you might
      be a bit sympathetic, because I've had a nasty knock. My creditors have
      come down on me, and I'm going to be married."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing smiled. He had some sense of humor, and Charnock's manner seemed
      to indicate that he felt he was confronted with two misfortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must have known your creditors would pull you up unless you came to
      terms with them, but one would expect you to please yourself about getting
      married."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not sure your joke's in good taste," Charnock answered sullenly. "But
      in a way, one thing depended on the other. Perhaps I oughtn't to have said
      so, but I'm upset to-night. Though I did expect to be pulled up, it was a
      knock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt. Are you going to marry Sadie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am. Have you any reason to disapprove?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not," said Festing. "Sadie's rather a friend of mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      In a sense, this was true. When Festing first came to the prairie from a
      mountain construction camp, where he had not seen a woman for twelve
      months, he had felt Sadie's charm. Moreover, he imagined that the girl
      liked him and consciously used her power, although with a certain reserve
      and modesty. For all that, he fought against his inclination and conquered
      without much effort. Marriage had not much attraction for him, but if he
      did marry, he meant to choose a wife of a different type.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sadie's a very good sort," Charnock resumed. "She knows what we are, and
      doesn't expect too much; not the kind of girl to make ridiculous demands.
      In fact, Sadie can make allowances."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing thought this was doubtful praise, although it bore out his opinion
      of the girl. For all that, Sadie might not be so willing to make
      allowances for her husband as for a lover of whom she was not quite sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps that kind of thing has advantages," he said. "But I don't know&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do know," said Charnock; "I've tried the other way. The feeling that
      you're expected to keep on a high plane soon gets tiresome; besides, it
      isn't natural. It's better to be taken for what you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose so," Festing assented. "Anyway, if Sadie's satisfied&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock grinned, although there was a touch of color in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're not given to flattery, but might use a little tact. I've had a
      knock and am not quite sober, so I can't argue the point. Then it isn't
      your business if Sadie's satisfied or not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so. But what are you going to do when your creditors turn you
      out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything's arranged. I'm going to help Keller at the hotel and store."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing got up. "Well, I've stopped longer than I meant. I wish you good
      luck!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll have a drink," said Charnock, reaching for the bottle with an
      unsteady hand. Then he paused and gave Festing a suspicious look. "It's
      curious about that portrait! I used to see you gazing at it, and don't
      remember that I picked it up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thanks," said Festing, refusing the glass. "I think you've had
      enough. In fact, it might have been better when you were wiping the slate
      clean if you had put the bottle in the stove."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out and walked back to the camp in the moonlight, thinking hard.
      He was angry with Charnock, but vaguely sorry. Bob had some virtues and
      was throwing himself away, although, when one came to think of it, this
      was only true to some extent. What one meant was that he was throwing away
      his opportunities of rising to a higher plane; while Bob was satisfied
      with his present level Sadie was good enough for him, perhaps too good.
      Life together might be hard for both, and there was a touch of pathos in
      his burning all the tender tokens that bound him to the past, though it
      was ominous that he kept the whisky. He could, however, get as much liquor
      as he wanted at the hotel; that is, if Sadie allowed it, but there was
      some comfort in the thought that the girl was clever and firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing dismissed the matter, and when he reached his shack at the bridge
      put the portrait on the table and sat down opposite. He felt that he knew
      this girl, whom he had never met, very well. Something in her look had
      cheered him when he had difficulties to overcome; he felt that they were
      friends. She was calm and fearless and would face trouble with the level
      glance he knew, although now and then, when the lamp flickered in the
      draught, he had thought she smiled. They had been companions on evenings
      when Charnock wanted to read the newspaper or the talk had flagged.
      Sometimes the window and door were open and the smell of parched grass
      came in; sometimes the stove was red-hot and the house shook in the icy
      blast. Festing admitted that it was not altogether for Charnock's society
      he had visited the homestead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he began to puzzle about a likeness to somebody he knew. He had
      remarked this before, but the likeness was faint and eluded him. Lighting
      his pipe, he tried to concentrate his thoughts, and by and by made an
      abrupt movement. He had it! When he was in British Columbia, engaged on
      the construction of a section of the railroad that was being built among
      the mountains, he met a young Englishman at a mining settlement. The lad
      had been ill and was not strong enough to undertake manual labor, which
      was the only occupation to be found in the neighborhood. Moreover, he had
      lost his money, in consequence, Festing gathered, of his trusting
      dangerous companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing, finding that he had been well educated and articled to a civil
      engineer, got him a post on the railroad, where he helped the surveyors.
      Dalton did well and showed himself grateful, but when Festing went to the
      prairie he lost touch with the lad. The latter wrote to him once or twice,
      but he was too busy to keep up the correspondence. Now he knew it was
      something in Dalton's face he found familiar in the portrait. The girl had
      a steady level glance, and the lad looked at one like that. Indeed, it was
      his air of frankness that had persuaded Festing to get him the post.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this led him nowhere. He did not know the girl's name, and if it was
      the same as the lad's, it would not prove that they were related. He
      pushed back his chair and got up. It looked as if he was in some danger of
      becoming a romantic fool, but he put the portrait carefully away, Soon
      after he had done so a man came in, and sitting down, lighted a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wanted to see you, Festing, but hadn't a chance all day," he said.
      "Probably you haven't heard that I've got orders where to send the staff
      when the bridge is finished, as it will be soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing looked up sharply. Kerr was his superior in the company's service,
      but they were on good terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't heard. I'm anxious to know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kerr told him, and Festing's face hardened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So Marvin and I go on to the next prairie section! Since they want the
      best men on the difficult work in the mountains, it means that we're
      passed over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does, in a sense," Kerr agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I think I know why you came," said Festing, who pondered for a few
      moments. He had courage and decision, and it was his habit to face a
      crisis boldly. "Now," he resumed, "I'm going to ask your opinion of my
      prospects if I stay on the road?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your record's good. You're sure of a post, so long as there's any
      construction work going on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A post of a kind! Not the best kind, where a man would have a chance of
      making his mark?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Kerr, "I think that's what I meant. The headquarters bosses
      don't know us personally, and judge by a man's training and the
      certificates he's got. Of course, in spite of this, talent will find its
      way, and sometimes one gets there by a stroke of luck."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing smiled, rather bitterly. "I have no marked talent, and haven't
      found it pay to trust to luck. In fact, my only recommendations are a kind
      of practical ability and a capacity for hard work. I got on the road by
      doing chores and fought my way up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are practical," Kerr agreed. "It's your strong point, but I've
      thought it sometimes kept you back."
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused when Festing looked at him with surprise, but resumed in a
      thoughtful voice: "When your job's in front of you, you see what must be
      done, and do it well; there's not a man on my section does that kind of
      thing better. Still, I'm not sure you always see quite far enough. You
      miss what lies ahead and sometimes, so to speak, what's lying all round.
      Concentration's good, but one can concentrate too much. However, I didn't
      come to find fault, but to let you know how matters are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks. I'm going to look ahead and all round now, and the situation
      strikes me as much like this: If I'm content with a second or third best
      post, I can stop; if I want to go as far as my power of concentration may
      take me and find a place where I can use my independent judgment, I'd
      better quit. Have I got that right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's what I tried to hint. You can count on my recommendation when it's
      likely to be of use, but you said something that was rather illuminating.
      You want to use your judgment?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing laughed. "I don't know that I've thought much about these matters,
      but I am an individualist. You get up against useless rules, empty
      formalities, and much general stupidity in organized effort, and good work
      is often wasted. When you see things that demand to be done, you want to
      begin right there and get at the job. If you wait to see if it's yours or
      somebody else's, you're apt not to start at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your plan has drawbacks now and then," Kerr remarked. "But what are you
      going to do about the other matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing was silent for a few moments. He had to make a momentous choice,
      but had known that he must do so and did not hesitate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to quit and try farming. After all, I don't know very much
      about railroad building; up to now I've got on rather by determination
      than knowledge. Then, if I stop with you, I'll come up against a locked
      door whenever I try to push ahead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are locked doors in other professions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so; but in a big organization you must knock and ask somebody to
      let you through, and unless you have a properly stamped ticket, they turn
      you back. When the job's your own you beat down the door."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've seen farmers who tried that plan left outside with badly jarred
      hands. Frost and rust and driving sand are difficult obstacles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes," said Festing. "But they're natural obstacles; you know what
      you're up against and can overcome them, if you're stubborn enough. What I
      really mean is, you don't trust to somebody else's good opinion; whether
      you fail or not depends upon yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Kerr, getting up, "I think you're making the right choice,
      but hope you won't forget me when you leave us. You'll have a friend in
      the company's service as long as I'm on the road."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out and Festing lighted his pipe. Now he had come to a decision,
      there was much that needed thought; but, to begin with, he knew of a
      suitable piece of land. Living in camp, he had saved the most part of his
      pay, and had inherited a small sum from an English relative. In
      consequence, he could buy the land, build a comfortable wooden house, and
      have something over to carry him on until he sold his first crop.
    </p>
    <p>
      He resolved to buy the land and set the carpenters to work, but could not
      leave the railroad for a month, when it would be rather late to make a
      start. Then he had worked without a break for twelve years, for the most
      part at camps where no amusement was possible, and resolved to take a
      holiday. He would go back to England, where he had a few friends, although
      his relatives were dead. This was, of course, an extravagance; but after
      the self-denial he had practised there was some satisfaction in being
      rash. Lighting another pipe, he abandoned himself to pleasant dreams of
      his first holiday.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A RASH PROMISE
    </h3>
    <p>
      A few days before he started for England, Festing went over to Charnock's
      homestead, which was shortly to be sold. The evenings were getting light,
      and although Festing had finished his day's work before he left the
      bridge, the glow of sunset flooded Charnock's living-room. The strong red
      light searched out the signs of neglect and dilapidation, the broken boots
      and harness that needed mending, the dust sticking to the resin-stains on
      the cracked walls, and the <i>gumbo</i> soil on the dirty floor. As
      Charnock glanced up a level ray touched his face and showed a certain
      sensual coarseness that one missed when the light was normal. Festing,
      however, knew the look, and although he had not remarked it when he first
      met Charnock, thought it had always been there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The change he had noted in his friend was only on the surface. Charnock
      had not really deteriorated in Canada; the qualities that had brought him
      down had been overlaid by a spurious grace and charm, but it now looked as
      if moral slackness might develop into active vice. On the whole, he
      thought Sadie would have trouble with Bob, but this was not his business.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've come to say good-bye," he remarked. "I won't see you again until my
      return, and expect you'll be married then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Charnock, shortly. "I suppose you have made some plans for
      your trip. Where are you going to stop in England?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing told him and he looked surprised. "I didn't know you had friends
      in that neighborhood. Will you be with them some time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A month, anyway. Then I may come and go."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock pushed his chair back out of the light. "Well, this makes it
      easier; there's something I want to ask. We are friends and I've let you
      give me good advice, though I haven't always acted on it. I don't know if
      this gives me a claim."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If there's anything I can do&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is," said Charnock, who hesitated for a few moments. "I want you to
      go and see Helen Dalton. She's the girl I ought to have married, and
      doesn't live very far from your friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Festing with a start. "It was her portrait you meant to burn?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock gave him a sharp glance. "Just so. I imagine I did burn it,
      because I couldn't find it afterwards."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a few moments while Festing wondered whether the
      other suspected him. Bob had an air of frankness, but was sometimes
      cunning. This, however, was not important, and Festing was strongly moved
      by the thought that he might see the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you want me to go?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In order that you can tell her how I was situated. I want her to know why
      I was forced to give her up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you have written and stated your reasons."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. But I've no talent for explanation, and in a letter you say
      too little or too much; probably I didn't say enough. Then you can't tell
      how far the person written to will understand, and questions rise. But
      will you go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing wanted to go, although he saw his task might be embarrassing. He
      had been some time in Western Canada, where people are frank and do not
      shrink from dealing with delicate matters. Then Charnock was his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be an awkward job, but you can indicate the line you think I
      ought to take."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The line is plain. You will tell Helen what it means to lose one's crop,
      and try to make her understand the struggle I've had&mdash;how the weather
      was against me, and the debts kept piling up until I was ruined. You can
      describe the havoc made by drought, and frost, and cutting sand. Then
      there's the other side of the matter; the hardships a woman must bear on
      the plains when money's scarce. The loneliness, the monotonous drudgery,
      the heat, the Arctic cold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Dalton looks as if she had pluck. She wouldn't be easily daunted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think I don't know? But when you meet her you'll see that the life
      we lead is impossible for a girl like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It looks as if you wanted me to be your advocate," Festing remarked
      rather dryly. "I'm to make all the excuses for you I can, and prove that
      you were justified in breaking your engagement. I doubt if I'm clever
      enough&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock stopped him. "No! Perhaps I used excuses, but my object is not to
      clear myself." He paused and colored. "We'll admit that Helen lost nothing
      when I gave her up; but a girl, particularly a young, romantic girl, feels
      that kind of thing, and it might hurt worse if she thought she had loved a
      wastrel. I want her to feel that I broke my engagement for her sake, when
      nothing else was possible. That might soften the blow, and I really think
      it's true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much of it is true?" Festing asked bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Charnock, "you're an uncompromising fellow. You meant that if
      you'd had my debts and difficulties, you could have made good?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might; but we both know two or three other men whom I'd have backed to
      do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For all that, you'll admit that the thing was impossible for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing knitted his brows. "I believe you could have overcome your
      difficulties; that is, if you had really made an effort and faced the
      situation earlier. But since you hadn't nerve enough, I dare say it was
      impossible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forget one thing; I hadn't time. At the best, it would have taken me
      three or four years to get straight, and as you haven't much imagination,
      I suppose you don't realize what Helen's trials would have been in the
      meanwhile. An engaged girl's situation isn't easy when her lover is away.
      She stands apart, forbidden much others may enjoy, and Helen would have
      had to bear her friends' contemptuous pity for being bound to a man who
      had turned out a failure or worse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expect that's true," Festing agreed. "However, there's another
      difficulty. Suppose I persuade Miss Dalton that you made a plucky fight
      and only gave her up when you were beaten? She may refuse to let you go,
      and insist on coming out to help."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock started, but with a rather obvious effort recovered his calm.
      "You must see your suggestion's stupid. Helen can't come out; I'm going to
      marry Sadie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I forgot," said Festing. "Well, since you urge me, I'll do what I can,
      although I don't like the job."
    </p>
    <p>
      He left the homestead shortly afterwards, but felt puzzled as he walked
      across the plain. When he suggested that Miss Dalton might resolve to join
      and help her lover, Charnock had looked alarmed. This was strange, because
      although Festing had, for a moment, forgotten Sadie, it was ridiculous to
      imagine that Bob had done so. Then why had he started. There were,
      however, one or two other things that disturbed Festing, who felt that he
      had made a rash promise. But the promise had been made, and he must do his
      best to carry it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a fine voyage, and a week after his arrival in the Old Country
      walked up and down the terrace of a house among the hills in the North of
      England. His host was an old friend of the family who had shown Festing
      some kindness when he was young, and his daughter, Muriel, approved her
      father's guest. She liked the rather frank, brown-skinned, athletic man,
      whom she had joined on the terrace. He was a new and interesting type; but
      although she was two or three years the younger and attractive, their
      growing friendship was free from possible complications. Muriel, as
      Festing had learned, was going to marry the curate.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the roar of activity at the bridge, where the hammers rang all day
      and often far into the night, he found his new surroundings strangely
      pleasant. In Canada, he had lived in the wilds; on the vast bare plains,
      and among snowy mountains where man grappled with Nature in her sternest
      mood. Thundering snowslides swept away one's work, icy rocks must be cut
      through, and savage green floods threatened the half-built track when the
      glaciers began to melt. Every day had brought a fresh anxiety, and now he
      welcomed the slackening of the strain. The struggle had left its mark on
      him; one saw it in his lean, muscular symmetry, his quiet alertness, and
      self-confidence. But he could relax, and found the English countryside had
      a soothing charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was low and rugged hills cut against the pale-saffron sky. The
      valley between was filled with blue shadow, but in the foreground a river
      twinkled in the fading light. Feathery larches grew close up to the house,
      and a beck splashed in the gloom among their trunks. Farther off, a dog
      barked, and there was a confused bleating of sheep, but this seemed to
      emphasize the peaceful calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's wonderfully quiet," Festing remarked. "I can't get used to the
      stillness; I feel as if I was dreaming and would wake up to hear the din
      of the rivers and the ballast roaring off the gravel cars. However, I have
      some business to do to-morrow that I'm not keen about. Can one see Knott
      Scar from here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the blue ridge, about six miles off. The dark patch on its slope is
      a big beech wood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then do you know the Daltons?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes," said Muriel. "Helen Dalton is a friend of mine. Although the
      Scar's some way off, I see her now and then. But are you going there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am; I wish it wasn't needful," Festing answered rather gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Muriel, giving him a sharp glance. "Helen was to have married a
      man in Canada, but the engagement was broken off. Do you know him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do. That's why I'm going to the Scar. I've promised to explain matters
      as far as I can."
    </p>
    <p>
      Muriel studied his disturbed face with a twinkle of amusement. "Well, I'm
      sorry for Helen; it must have been a shock. For all that, I thought the
      engagement a mistake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you have seen Charnock?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once. He's a friend of some people Helen used to stay with in the South,
      but I met him at the Scar. Handsome, and charming, in a way, but I thought
      him weak."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are Miss Dalton's people like?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you want to know what Helen is like?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Festing. "I know her already; that is, I've seen her picture."
    </p>
    <p>
      Muriel, glancing at him keenly, did not understand his look, but replied:
      "Helen lives with her mother and aunt, but it's hard to describe them.
      They are not old, but seem to date back to other times. In fact, they're
      rather unique nowadays. Like very dainty old china; you'd expect them to
      break if they were rudely jarred. You feel they ought to smell of orris
      and lavender."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Festing. "I was a fool to promise Charnock. I've never met
      people like that, and am afraid they'll get a jar to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think you need be afraid," Muriel replied. "They're not really
      prudish or censorious, though they are fastidious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is Miss Dalton like her mother and aunt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a way. Helen has their refinement, but she's made of harder stuff. She
      would wear better among strains and shocks."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing shook his head. "Girls like her ought to be sheltered and kept
      from shocks. After all, there's something to be said for Charnock's point
      of view. Your delicate English grace and bloom ought to be protected and
      not rubbed off by the rough cares of life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know if you're nice or not," Muriel rejoined with a laugh.
      "Anyway, you don't know many English girls, and your ideas about us are
      old-fashioned. We are not kept in lavender now. Besides, it isn't the
      surface bloom that matters, and fine stuff does not wear out. It takes a
      keener edge and brighter polish from strenuous use. And Helen is fine
      stuff."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I thought," said Festing quietly, and stopped at the end of the
      terrace. The bleating of sheep had died away, and except for the splash of
      the beck a deep silence brooded over the dale. The sun had set and the
      landscape was steeped in soft blues and grays, into which woods and hills
      slowly melted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's remarkably pleasant here," he said. "Not a sign of strain and hurry;
      things seem to run on well-oiled wheels! Perhaps the greatest change is to
      feel that one has nothing to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you had holidays now and then in Canada."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Festing. "Anyhow I've had none for a very long time. Of course
      there are lonely places, and in winter the homesteads on the plains are
      deadly quiet, but I was always where some big job was rushed along.
      Hauling logs across the snow, driving them down rivers, and after I joined
      the railroad, checking calculations, and track-grading in the rain. It was
      a fierce hustle from sunrise to dark, with all your senses highly strung
      and your efforts speeded up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then one can understand why it's a relief to lounge. But would that
      satisfy you long?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing laughed. "It would certainly satisfy me for a time, but after that
      I don't know. It's a busy world, and there's much to be done."
    </p>
    <p>
      Muriel studied him as they walked back along the terrace. He wore no hat,
      and she liked the way he held his head and his light, springy step, though
      she smiled as she noted that he pulled himself up to keep pace with her.
      It was obvious that he was not used to moving leisurely. Then his figure,
      although spare, was well proportioned, and his rather thin face was frank.
      He had what she called a fined-down look, but concentrated effort of mind
      and body had given him a hint of distinction. He was a man who did things,
      and she wondered what Helen, who was something of a romantic dreamer,
      would think of him. Then she reflected with a touch of amusement that he
      would probably find the errand his friend had given him embarrassing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't look forward to seeing the Daltons to-morrow," she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so," Festing admitted. "I didn't quite know what I'd undertaken
      when I gave my promise. The thing looks worse in England. In fact, it
      looks very nearly impossible just now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you are going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing spread out his hands. "Certainly. What can I do? Charnock hustled
      me into it; he has a way of getting somebody else to do the things he
      shirks. But I gave him my word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that's binding!" remarked Muriel, who was half amused by his
      indignation. She thought Charnock deserved it, but Festing could be
      trusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I could ask your advice," he resumed. "You could tell me what to
      say; but as I don't know if Charnock would approve, it mightn't be the
      proper thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Muriel was keenly curious to learn the truth about her friend's love
      affair, but she resisted the temptation. Because she liked Festing, she
      would not persuade him to do something for which he might afterwards
      reproach himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she said, "perhaps you oughtn't to tell me. But I don't think you
      need be nervous. If you have the right feeling, you will take the proper
      line."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they went into the house where the curate was talking to Gardiner.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      FESTING KEEPS HIS WORD
    </h3>
    <p>
      Next afternoon Festing leaned his borrowed bicycle against the gate at
      Knott Scar and walked up the drive. He had grave misgivings, but it was
      too late to indulge them, and he braced himself and looked about with keen
      curiosity. The drive curved and a bank of shrubs on one side obstructed
      his view, but the Scar rose in front, with patches of heather glowing a
      rich crimson among the gray rocks. Beneath these, a dark beech wood rolled
      down the hill. On the other side there was a lawn that looked like green
      velvet. His trained eye could detect no unevenness; the smooth surface
      might have been laid with a spirit level. Festing had seen no grass like
      this in Canada and wondered how much labor it cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he came to the end of the shrubs and saw a small, creeper-covered
      house, with a low wall, pierced where shallow steps went up, along the
      terrace. The creeper was in full leaf and dark, but roses bloomed about
      the windows and bright-red geraniums in urns grew upon the wall. He heard
      bees humming and a faint wind in the beech tops, but the shadows scarcely
      moved upon the grass, and a strange, drowsy quietness brooded over the
      place. Indeed, the calm was daunting; he felt he belonged to another world
      and was intruding there, but went resolutely up the shallow steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two white-haired ladies received him in a shady, old-fashioned room with a
      low ceiling. There was a smell of flowers, but it was faint, and he
      thought it harmonized with the subdued lighting of the room. A horizontal
      piano stood in a corner and the dark, polished rosewood had dull
      reflections; some music lay about, but not in disorder, and he noted the
      delicate modeling of the cabinet with diamond panes it had been taken
      from. He knew nothing about furniture, but he had an eye for line and
      remarked the taste that characterized the rest of the articles. There were
      a few landscapes in water-color, and one or two pieces of old china, of a
      deep blue that struck the right note of contrast with the pale-yellow
      wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing felt that the house had an influence; a gracious influence
      perhaps, but vaguely antagonistic to him. He had thought of a house as a
      place in which one ate and slept, but did not expect it to mold one's
      character. Surroundings like this were no doubt Helen Dalton's proper
      environment, but he came from the outside turmoil, where men sweated and
      struggled and took hard knocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, he talked to and studied the two ladies. Although they
      had white hair, they were younger than he thought at first and much alike.
      It was as if they had faded prematurely from breathing too rarefied an
      atmosphere and shutting out rude but bracing blasts. Still they had a
      curious charm, and he had felt a hint of warmth in Mrs. Dalton's welcome
      that puzzled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have been expecting you. Bob told us you would come," she said in a
      low, sweet voice, and added with a smile: "I wanted to meet you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing wondered what Bob had said about him, but for a time they
      tactfully avoided the object of his visit and asked him questions about
      his journey. Then Mrs. Dalton got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Helen is in the garden. Shall we look for her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She took him across the lawn to a bench beneath a copper beech, and
      Festing braced himself when a girl got up. She wore white and the shadow
      of the leaves checkered the plain dress. He noted the unconscious grace of
      her pose as she turned towards him, and her warm color, which seemed to
      indicate a sanguine temperament. Helen Dalton was all that he had thought,
      and something more. He knew her level, penetrating glance, but she had a
      virility he had not expected. The girl was somehow stronger than he
      portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I had better leave you to talk to Mr. Festing," Mrs. Dalton said
      presently and moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen waited with a calm that Festing thought must cost her much, and
      moving a folding chair, he sat down opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand Bob told you I would come," he said. "You see, he is a
      friend of mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she replied with a faint sparkle in her eyes. "He hinted that you
      would explain matters. I think he meant you would make some defense for
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing noted that her voice was low like her mother's, but it had a
      firmer note. He could be frank with her, but there was a risk that he
      might say too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said, "I may make mistakes. In fact, it was with much
      reluctance I promised to come, and if Bob hadn't insisted&mdash;&mdash;"
      He paused and pulled himself together. "On the surface, of course, his
      conduct looks inexcusable, but he really has some defense, and I think you
      ought to hear it, for your own sake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I ought," she agreed quietly. "Well, I am willing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing began by relating Charnock's troubles. He meant her to understand
      the situation and supplied rather confusing particulars about prairie
      farming and mortgages. For all that, the line he took was strong; he
      showed how Charnock's embarrassments prevented his offering her comforts
      she would find needful and saving her from the monotonous toil an
      impoverished farmer's wife must undertake. In the meantime, but
      unconsciously, he threw some light on Charnock's vacillating character.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he stopped Helen mused for a few minutes. Although she had got a
      shock when Charnock gave her up, she knew her lover better than when she
      had promised to marry him. He came home once in the winter and she had
      remarked a change. Bob was not altogether the man she had thought; there
      were things that jarred, and his letters gradually made this plainer.
      Still she had meant to keep her promise, and his withdrawal hurt. She had
      borne something for his sake, because her mother and her relations had not
      approved the engagement. Then she roused herself and turned to Festing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have done your best for your friend and Bob ought to be grateful, but
      you both start from a wrong point. Why do you take it for granted that I
      would shrink from hardship?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't imagine you would shrink," Festing declared. "For all that, Bob
      was right. The life is too hard for a girl brought up like you." He
      hesitated a moment. "I mean for a girl brought up in your surroundings."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen smiled and he knew it was a sign of courage, but had a vague feeling
      that he understood why she did so as he looked about. The sighing in the
      beech tops had died away and the shadows did not move upon the lawn. A
      heavy smell of flowers came from the borders and the house seemed to be
      sleeping in the hot sunshine. Everything was beautiful, well-ordered, and
      tranquil, but he knew if he stayed there long he would hear the cry of the
      black geese and the clang of flung-down rails ring through the soporific
      calm. Something in the girl's face indicated that she might find the calm
      oppressive and sympathize with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is Bob going to do now he has lost his farm?" she asked after a
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In one respect, he won't be much worse off. They expect a boom at the
      settlement, and he'll manage the hotel and store and poolroom for Keller.
      The old man will probably retire soon and Bob will get the business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why should the proprietor give the business to Bob?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's Sadie's father," Festing answered with some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But who is Sadie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing looked up sharply and saw that Helen was puzzled and suspicious.
      Her eyes were harder and her mouth was set.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" he said. "Don't you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A wave of color flushed Helen's face, but her voice was level. "I don't
      know! It looks as if Bob had not told me the most important thing. Do you
      mean that he is going to marry Miss Keller?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing felt pitiful. He saw that she had got a shock, but she bore it
      pluckily, and he tried to conquer his indignant rage. Charnock had let him
      believe he had told her; he ought to have realized that the fellow could
      not act straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you knew," he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's obvious," Helen replied with an effort for calm. "But tell me
      something about Miss Keller."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sadie runs the hotel and helps at the store. She's rather pretty and
      intelligent. In fact, she's generally capable and a good manager."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to know her well since you call her Sadie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," said Festing, "everybody calls her Sadie!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean in the bar and poolroom? I understand the latter's a public
      billiard-saloon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing felt that he must do Sadie justice. She had her virtues, and
      although he was very angry with Charnock he did not want Helen to think
      the fellow had given her up for a worthless rival. Still he was not sure
      if his putting the girl in a favorable light would soften the blow or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To begin with, they don't employ women in a Canadian bar. Then Sadie's
      quite a good sort and understands Bob&mdash;perhaps better than an English
      girl could. She was brought up on the plains and knows all about the life
      we lead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You imply that she is not fastidious, and will be lenient to her
      husband's faults? That she will bring him down to her level?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Festing, who thought Helen did not know Charnock's dissipated
      habits, "I imagine she'll keep him there, and that's something. I mean she
      won't let him sink below her level; Sadie's shrewd and determined. Then
      marriage is a problem to men like Bob farming the plains. Girls of the
      type they have been used to and would naturally choose couldn't stand the
      hardships."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So they are satisfied with a lower type? With any girl who pleases their
      eye?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think that's quite fair," Festing objected. "Besides, lower is
      rather vague."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then would you, for example, be satisfied with a girl like Miss Keller?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not," said Festing, with incautious firmness. "Anyway, not now
      I've seen a different kind in the Old Country."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen turned her head and said nothing for a few moments. Then she got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you have had a difficult task, Mr. Festing, and I must thank you
      for the way you have carried it out. We won't speak of it again; but
      perhaps if Muriel Gardiner&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She hasn't asked me any questions or hinted that she is curious."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a gleam of amusement in Helen's eyes. "So you imagined she
      wasn't interested! Well, you can tell her about Bob's losses and farming
      troubles. You understand these matters, and it will save me something."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing made a sign of agreement and Helen went with him to the terrace,
      where Mrs. Dalton told him when he would find them at home if he wished to
      come again. He was glad to leave because he thought the interview had been
      difficult for Helen, but her mother had made him feel that if he came back
      he would be welcome. This was not altogether conventional politeness; he
      imagined she wanted to see him, although she was obviously willing to let
      him go then.
    </p>
    <p>
      He puzzled about it and other matters as he rode back. Helen Dalton was
      finer than her picture. He had, no doubt, been awkward and had hurt her by
      his clumsiness, while she had got a painful shock, but had borne it with
      unflinching pluck. Her calm had not deceived him, since he knew what it
      cost, and her smile had roused his pity because it was so brave. Then his
      anger against Charnock returned with extra force. The fellow, as usual,
      had shirked his duty, and left him to tell the girl he had really given
      her up because he meant to marry somebody else. Festing thought she was
      too just to blame him for Bob's fault, but he had been forced to witness
      her humiliation, and she would, no doubt, avoid him because of this. Well,
      he had done with Bob, although he would see him once on his return and
      tell him what he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he heard a shout and saw a farmer trying to move a loaded cart out of
      his way. He had not noticed that he was riding furiously down a hill, but
      he sped past the cart upon the grassy margin of the road and laughed as he
      went on. His mood had changed and he resolved that he would go back to the
      creeper-covered house when Helen had had time to recover and his society
      would be less disturbing. After all, Mrs. Dalton had told him he might
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening he walked up and down the terrace with Muriel, and told her
      why he had gone to Knott Scar, although he was satisfied with relating
      Charnock's financial troubles and said nothing about his engagement to
      Sadie. He could not say that Muriel actually led him on, but he felt that
      she would be disappointed if he did not take her into his confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I saw you knew all about it," she said when he stopped.
      "Besides, I expected that Helen would give you leave to tell me. It would
      make things easier for her and be more authentic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should expect Miss Dalton to think of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Muriel smiled. "Perhaps not. Well, I imagine it's lucky Charnock released
      her; Helen is much too good for him. I suppose you thought you took the
      proper line in laying all the stress you could upon the hardships?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did. I thought she couldn't stand the strain she would have had to
      bear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did she take that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She seemed surprised, as if she didn't think it much of a reason for
      Charnock letting her go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frankly, I don't think it was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You haven't been to Canada. The life is hard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It doesn't seem to have broken down your health or nerve."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's different. A man gets used to hardships and discomfort. They're
      sometimes bracing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very masculine attitude! Then men alone have pluck and endurance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are two kinds of pluck," Festing rejoined. "I dare say you surpass
      us in the moral kind&mdash;I'm sure Miss Dalton has more than Charnock.
      But there's the other; physical courage, and if you like, physical
      strength."
    </p>
    <p>
      Muriel looked amused. "And you imagine Helen is deficient there? Well, I
      suppose you don't know she's the best tennis player in the county and a
      daring rock-climber. Girls are taking to mountaineering now, you know. But
      are you going back to the Daltons?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing thought she gave him a keen glance, but answered steadily: "I am
      going back, but not for some time. I want to go, but it might be kinder if
      I kept away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it's a very proper feeling and you're rather nice. But you talked
      about going to see the mountains for a few days. When do you start?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know yet. Everything here is so charming, and I'm getting the
      habit of lazy enjoyment. It will need an effort to go away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're certainly nice," Muriel rejoined, smiling. "However, you might
      tell me when you do think of starting. I don't want you to be away when we
      have arranged something to amuse you; and then, as I know the mountains, I
      can indicate an interesting tour. You might miss much if you didn't know
      where to go and what you ought to see."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing promised, and she left him and went back to the house with a
      thoughtful smile that hinted that she had begun to make an amusing plan.
      Muriel was romantic and rather fond of managing her friends' affairs for
      their good.

      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HELEN TAKES THE LEAD
    </h3>
    <p>
      Festing was glad to sit down when he reached the bottom of a chasm that
      divided the summits of two towering fells. He had crossed the higher of
      the two without much trouble except for a laborious scramble over large,
      rough stones, but the ascent of the other threatened to be difficult. It
      rose in front, a wall of splintered crag, seamed by deep gullies, for the
      strata was tilted up nearly perpendicular. All the gullies were climbed by
      expert mountaineers, but this needed a party and a rope, and the other
      way, round the shoulder of the great rock, was almost as hard. Festing
      knew the easiest plan was to descend a neighboring hollow, from which he
      would find a steep path to the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lighting his pipe, he glanced at his watch. It was three o'clock in the
      afternoon, and having been on his feet since breakfast, he felt tired. The
      nails he had had driven into his light American boots hurt his feet, and
      the boots were much the worse for the last few days' wear. Muriel had
      carefully planned the trip, and then delayed his start by a week because
      she wanted to take him to a tennis party. Since he could not play tennis
      much, Festing did not see why she had done so, but agreed when she
      insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, he had followed her instructions and admitted that she had
      directed him well, because it was hard to imagine there was anything in
      England finer than the country he had seen. The mountains had not the
      majestic grandeur of the British Columbian ranges, but they were wild
      enough, and pierced by dales steeped in sylvan beauty. The chasm in which
      he now rested had an impressive ruggedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blinks of sunshine touched the lower face of the crag, and in their track
      the dark rock glittered with a steely luster, but trails of mist rolled
      among the crannies above. Below, a precipitous slope of small stones that
      the dalesmen call a scree ran down to a hollow strewn with broken rocks,
      and across this he could distinguish the blurred flat top of another
      height. The mountain dropped to a dale that looked profoundly deep,
      although he could not see its bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light was puzzling. For the most part, the sky was clear and the
      gleams of sun were hot, but heavy, black clouds drifted about, and a thick
      gray haze obscured the lower ground. Rain and mist would be dangerous
      obstacles, but Festing understood that he could reach the dale in about
      two hours' steady walking. Muriel had told him where to stop; indeed, she
      had been rather particular about this, and had recommended him to spend
      two days in the neighborhood. Luckily, there would be no crags to climb if
      he kept the path across the summit, for he had found it easier to reach
      the top of the hills than get down by a different line.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rattle of stones made him look up, and he saw two girls silhouetted in a
      flash of sunshine against the face of the crag. They carried bulging
      rucksacks and were coming down towards him, picking their way among the
      tumbled rocks. He could not see the face of the first, but noticed her
      light poise and graceful movements as she sprang from stone to stone. The
      other followed cautiously and Festing thought she limped, but when the
      first stopped to wait for her and lifted her head he felt a curious
      thrill. It was Helen Dalton.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat still, knowing his gray clothes would be hard to distinguish among
      the stones, and wondering what to do. He did not want to force his society
      upon the girl just yet, but would be disappointed if she passed. She came
      on, and when her eyes rested on him he got up. A flush of embarrassment
      colored her face, but she stopped and greeted him with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Festing! How did you get here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came over the Pike," said Festing. "I'm going to the dale."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So are we," said Helen, who presented him to her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing remarked that they wore jackets that had a tanned look, unusually
      short skirts, and thick nailed boots. Then he thought Helen's eyes
      twinkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would not have expected to find me engaged in anything so strenuous
      as this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is rather strenuous," Miss Jardine broke in. "You can stand if you
      like; I'm going to sit down."
    </p>
    <p>
      They found a flat stone, and when Festing leaned against another Helen
      resumed: "We meant to try the Stairs, but have had a hard day and Alison
      is lame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hurt my foot," Miss Jardine explained. "Besides, I'm from the level
      Midlands and we have been walking since breakfast. That doesn't matter to
      Helen; she is never tired."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing thought Helen looked remarkably fresh. Exertion and the mountain
      air had brought a fine color to her face, her eyes were bright, and there
      was a hint of vigor in her resting pose. Moreover, he had studied the
      Stairs, which led behind the shoulder of the crag to the summit. One could
      get up, if one was thin enough to squeeze through a gap between two rocks,
      but nerve and agility would be required.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you must climb pretty well, if you meant to get up the Stairs," he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know the Carnarvon range, but only go there now and then, and one needs
      some training to keep pace with people born among the fells who walk like
      mountain goats."
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she said a mountain deer, Festing would have approved, for he had
      noted Helen's easy balance and fearless grace as she crossed the ragged
      blocks of stone. Then a rumble of distant thunder rolled among the crags
      and Miss Jardine resumed: "We ought to fix upon the best way down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The best is a rather elastic term," Helen rejoined. "The easiest would be
      to go back by the way we came."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's much too far."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The shortest is up the crag by the Stairs or the gully on the other side.
      The regular track takes us down near the bottom of the next dale, and then
      back over the top."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's unthinkable," Miss Jardine declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Helen thoughtfully, "there's a short line down the scree and
      across the shoulder of the fell below, but it's steep and rough. There are
      some small crags, too, but they're not much of an obstacle when they're
      dry."
    </p>
    <p>
      They set off and Festing noticed Helen's confidence on the scree. The
      descent was safe, but looked daunting, because their figures made a sharp
      angle with the gravel slope, and now and then a mass of dislodged stones
      rushed down hill. Sometimes the girl allowed herself to slide, sometimes
      she ran a few yards and sprang, but she did not stumble or lose her
      balance. Miss Jardine was cautious, and Festing kept near her, carrying
      her sack.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the bottom they came to a wide belt of massive stones, fallen from the
      heights above, and their progress was slow. One had to measure the gaps
      between the blocks and step carefully across, while the stones were ragged
      and had sharp corners. Festing was unable to look up and followed Helen,
      but after a time Miss Jardine stopped, and he saw that the crags were
      smothered in leaden cloud and all the sky was dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must have a few minutes' rest," the tired girl declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they sat down on the edge of a ponderous slab there was a crash of
      thunder that rolled from rock to rock, and a few big drops fell. Then as
      the echoes died away the hillside was hidden by a curtain of driving rain.
      One end of the slab was tilted and they crept into the hollow underneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be awkward if this goes on," Miss Jardine remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These thunderstorms seldom last," said Helen. "I expect we have seen the
      worst, and we must start again as soon as we can see."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing thought she was anxious to get down, but Miss Jardine grumbled
      about the rain, and then turned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a relief to give you my sack, and I was glad to see it didn't
      bother you. I suppose you are used to these mountains."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Festing. "This is the first time I've climbed a hill for
      amusement."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you are a climber. You have balance, trust your feet and not your
      hands, and know how to step on a loose stone."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing laughed. "I used to do something of the kind as a matter of
      business. You see, I helped mark out the line for a new railroad in
      British Columbia, and rocks are plentiful in that country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be a wonderful place," said Helen. "I have a photograph of the
      gorge at the foot of the glacier, where the line went through. You had
      stern work when you laid the rails in winter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing looked at her in surprise, for he had worked to the edge of
      exhaustion and run many risks at the spot, but while he wondered how she
      knew Helen got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think the rain is stopping and we can start," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not much rain, but thick mist rolled across the top of the hill
      they were now level with, and everything below was blotted out. Leaving
      the stones, they crossed a belt of boggy grass where their feet sank, but
      Festing felt it a relief to have done with the rocks. The narrow tableland
      they were crossing was comfortingly flat, and he looked forward to
      descending a long grassy slope. When they reached the edge, however, he
      got a rude disappointment, for the mist rolled up in waves with intervals
      between, and when a white cloud passed a gray light shone down into the
      gulf at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the foreground there was a steep slope where rock ledges broke through
      the wet turf, and in one place a chasm cleft the hill. He could not see
      the bottom, for it was filled with mist, but the height of the rock wall
      hinted at its depth. A transverse ravine ran into the chasm, and he could
      hear the roar of a waterfall. Then the mist rolled up in a white smother
      and blotted everything out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We cross the beck," said Helen. "Then we go nearly straight down, keeping
      this side of the big ghyll."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As far away as possible, I hope. I don't like its look," Miss Jardine
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing agreed with her. So far as he could see, the descent looked
      forbidding, but there was no sign of the sky's clearing, and it was
      obvious that they must get down. The thunder had gone, but the mist
      brought a curious, searching damp, and a cold wind had begun to blow. He
      was glad to think Helen knew the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took them down a steep pitch where small rocky ledges dropped nearly
      vertical among patches of rotten turf and it was needful to get a good
      grip with one's hands as well as with one's feet. Festing helped Miss
      Jardine when he could, but he had an unpleasant feeling that a rash step
      might take him over the edge of a precipice. Sometimes he could see Helen
      in front, and sometimes, for a few moments, her figure was lost in the
      mist. He was glad to note that she was apparently going down with
      confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time the slope got easier and she stopped, lifting her hand.
      Festing found her looking into a ravine through which water flowed. It was
      not very deep, but its sides were perpendicular. Seeing that Miss Jardine
      was some distance behind, she looked at Festing with a quiet smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a place where one can cross without much trouble, but I don't
      know whether to go up or down."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing felt his heart beat. It looked as if she had taken him into her
      confidence and asked his help.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not down, I think. That would take us to the big ghyll. Let's try up, and
      cross at the first practicable spot."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen made a sign of agreement, and when Miss Jardine joined them they
      turned back along the edge of the ravine. By and by Helen stopped where
      patches of wet soil checkered the steep rock and a mountain-ash offered a
      hold. Almost immediately below the spot, the stream plunged over a ledge
      and vanished into the mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing looked at Helen. The descent would be awkward, if not dangerous,
      but he could trust her judgment. It was the first time he had allowed a
      woman to give him a lead in a difficulty, and he admitted that he would
      not have done so had his guide been anybody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think we can get across, and I don't want to go too far up," she said.
      "If you don't mind helping Alison&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll throw the sacks across first," Festing replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      He swung them round by the straps and let them go, and when the last
      splashed into a boggy patch on the other side Miss Jardine laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm selfishly glad that one is yours. If Helen's had fallen a foot short,
      it would have gone over the fall, but I expect she had a reason for taking
      the risk. Where our clothes have gone we must follow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen seized a tuft of heather, and sliding down, reached a narrow shelf
      four or five feet below. Then a small mountain-ash gave her a fresh hold
      and she dropped to the top of a projecting stone. Below this there was
      another shelf and some boggy grass, after which a bank of earth dropped
      nearly straight to the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How we shall get down the last pitch isn't very obvious," Miss Jardine
      remarked. "I suppose we will see when we arrive. It isn't my resolution
      that gives way, but my foot. You might go first."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing dropped on to the first shelf, and she came down into his arms.
      The shock nearly flung him off, but he steadied her with an effort and
      seized the stem of the small tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Looks like a tight-wire trick," he said, glancing at the stone. "However,
      if we miss it, there's another ledge below."
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached the stone, and balancing on it with one foot, kicked a hole in
      the spongy turf. Finding this would support him he held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now. As lightly as you can!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl came down, struck the stone with her foot, and slipped, but
      Festing had time to clutch her first. He could not hold her back, but he
      could steady her, and for a moment felt his muscles crack and the peat
      tear out from the hole in the bank. Then his hands slipped and he fell,
      gasping and red in face, upon the shelf beside the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you; you did that rather well," she said. "It looks as if I were
      heavier than you thought."
    </p>
    <p>
      While he had been occupied Festing imagined he had heard a splash, and now
      looking down saw Helen standing on a boulder in the stream. She gave him
      an approving nod before she sprang to the next stone, and he felt a thrill
      of pleasure. She knew his task was difficult and was satisfied with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they came to the scar where the floods had torn away the bank he
      hesitated. It was some distance to the water, and there was no hold upon
      the wall of soil, which was studded with small round stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Helen slid," his companion remarked. "I imagine she chose her time; the
      sitting glissade isn't elegant. But if you'll go first and wait&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing leaned back with his shoulders against the bank and pushed off. He
      alighted in the water, and Miss Jardine, coming down, kicked his arm. He
      saved her from a plunge into the stream, but thought she looked something
      the worse for wear as they made their way from stone to stone. The other
      bank was easier, and for a time they had not much trouble in going down
      hill, but the mist was very thick, and presently the steep slope broke off
      close in front. Helen stopped and beckoned Festing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking down, he saw the wet face of a crag drop into the rolling vapor.
      For eight or nine feet it was perpendicular, and afterwards ran down at a
      very steep slant, but immediately below there was a gully with a foot or
      two of level gravel at its top.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is not the regular track," Helen said. "However, I think I know the
      gully."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing pondered. The rock looked daunting, but one might get down to the
      patch of gravel. The trouble was that one could not see what lay below,
      and it might be difficult to climb back, if this was needful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could get as far as the edge yonder," he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Helen. "You don't know the gully, and if I'm mistaken about it,
      you could help me up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's true. Still I'd sooner go."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen shook her head, and although she did not speak, he felt there was
      something delightful in her consulting him. They had come to know each
      other on the misty hillside in a way that would not have been possible in
      conventional surroundings. He had seen a possibility of the girl, so to
      speak, shutting him out in self-defense because he had had some part in
      her humiliation, but he thought that risk had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he resumed, "what do you propose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to see if this is the place I think. You can steady me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing lay down with his head over the edge and found a grip for his toes
      and knees. There were a few cracks in the rock and Helen had got half way
      down before she took his hands. He felt the strain and braced himself,
      determined that he would be pulled over before he let her fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Loose me now," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you got a safe hold for your foot?" Festing gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I have. Let go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Make sure first," he answered with a sobbing breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up into his set face, and although the strain was heavy he
      thrilled as he saw her smile. The smile indicated courage and trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm quite safe," she said, and he let her go.
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned cautiously over the next edge, but after a moment or two turned
      and waved her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is the way I thought. Send Alison down."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jardine descended with some help from both, and Festing dropped
      safely on the gravel. He leaned against the rock to get his breath, and
      Helen turned to him with a twinkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You doubted my nerve once. I suppose that was why you didn't let go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sometimes dull," said Festing. "Just now, however, I wanted to make
      certain I could help you back."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen laughed. "Well, I dare say you could have lifted me, but it would
      have been simpler to lower me your coat."
    </p>
    <p>
      They went down the gully, where jambed stones made rude steps, and
      reaching the bottom found a belt of grass that led them to the head of a
      dale. The mist was thinner, and presently a few scattered houses appeared
      across the fields. The path they followed forked, and Helen stopped at the
      turning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The hotel is yonder to the right," she said. "We are going to the hall,
      where they sometimes take people in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing remembered that Muriel had indicated the hall, which he understood
      was a well-built farm, as his stopping place. He wanted to go there, but
      thought there was some risk of its looking as if he meant to force his
      society on the girls. He took the path Helen indicated, and when he had
      gone some distance, stopped, hesitated, and then went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls noted this and Miss Jardine said: "I suppose he remembered that
      he has my sack, or else his heart failed him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen looked at her in surprise. "Did you forget?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not," Miss Jardine admitted. "I thought I wouldn't spoil the plot.
      It looked as if he wanted an excuse for meeting us again, but I think I
      wronged him. That sudden stop was genuine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sack is yours," said Helen dryly. "But you will need the things
      inside."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I imagine I will get them before long, although it doesn't seem to have
      struck him that my clothes are damp. It's rather significant that he went
      on when he could have run across the field and caught us up. Have you
      known him long?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I met him once," said Helen with an impatient frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather a good type," Miss Jardine remarked. "I think I should like
      Canadians, if they're all like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He isn't a Canadian."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then he hasn't been in England for some time, and so far as my knowledge
      goes, men like variety. Of course, to some extent, he saw us under a
      disadvantage. Mountaineering clothes are comfortable, but one can't say
      much more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be ridiculous," Helen rejoined and went on across the field.

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A DEBT OF GRATITUDE
    </h3>
    <p>
      After dinner Festing walked across the fields to the farm. It was raining
      and a cold wind swept the dale, but a fire burned in the room into which
      he was shown and the curtains were drawn. Helen and Miss Jardine got up
      when he came in and put the rucksack on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry I forgot this until I'd gone some distance," he said. "Then I
      couldn't find anybody to send with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt you wanted your dinner," Miss Jardine suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing saw that she wore a different dress that looked rather large.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he said, "it wasn't the dinner that stopped me. Besides, it didn't
      strike me that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I might need my clothes? Well, I don't suppose it would strike you;
      but since you have come across in the rain, won't you stop?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing found an old leather chair, and sitting down, looked about with a
      sense of satisfaction, for the fire was cheerful after the raw cold
      outside. The room was large and old-fashioned, with heavy beams across the
      low ceiling. There was a tall clock, and a big, black oak chest; curled
      ram's horns and brass candlesticks twinkled on the mantel; an old copper
      kettle threw back red reflections near the fire. His companions occupied
      opposite sides of a large sheepskin rug, and he felt that both had charm,
      though they were different. The contrast added something to the charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jardine's skin was a pure white; her hair and eyes were nearly black,
      and she had a sparkling, and perhaps rather daring, humor. Helen's colors
      were rose and cream, her hair changed from warm brown to gold as it caught
      the light, and her eyes were calm and gray. She was younger than the other
      and he thought her smile delightful, but, as a rule, she was marked by a
      certain gravity. Her wide brows and the firm lines of her mouth and nose
      hinted at pride and resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope your foot is better," he said to Miss Jardine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, thanks. It mainly needed rest, and I must confess that I didn't find
      it altogether a drawback when we stopped at the bottom of the big crag. I
      should have had to go up if I hadn't been lame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were not disappointed because you couldn't reach the top?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jardine laughed. "Helen was. She makes it a rule to accomplish what
      she undertakes. I wasn't disappointed then, though I am now. Perhaps one
      really enjoys mountaineering best afterwards. You like to think how
      adventurous you have been, but it's sometimes difficult while the
      adventure's going on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's true," Festing agreed. "Still you feel sorry if, as we say, you
      are unable to put the thing over."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen gave him a sympathetic smile. "Yes; one feels that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It depends upon one's temperament," Miss Jardine objected. "I know my
      limits, though Helen does not know hers. When I can't get what I'm out
      for, I'm satisfied with less. One can't always have the best."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's worth trying for, anyway," Festing replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was afraid this sounded priggish. Miss Jardine got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm not much of a philosopher and had better put out some of the
      clothes you brought to dry, although it was thoughtful of you to throw
      your bag into the bog instead of mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was an accident," Festing declared. "I meant to throw them both
      across."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jardine picked up the sack. "There's nobody else here and a wet
      evening's dreary. I hope you won't go before I come back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't," said Festing. "They have only a deaf tourist and two tired
      climbers, who seem sleepy and bad-tempered, at the hotel."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jardine's eyes twinkled. "Well," she said as she went out, "I suppose
      it's a fair retort."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing colored and looked at Helen apologetically. "You see, I have lived
      in the woods."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expect that has some advantages," said Helen, who liked his frank
      embarrassment. "However, it was lucky I met you to-day. You didn't come
      back to see us, and there is something&mdash;&mdash;" She hesitated and
      then gave him a steady glance. "You are not so much a stranger to us as
      you imagine."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing wondered what she meant and whether she knew about the portrait,
      but she resumed: "As a matter of fact, my mother and I felt that we knew
      you rather well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some time since, you found a young Englishmen in a Western mining town.
      He had been ill and things had gone against him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Festing sharply. "Of course! I ought to have known&mdash;&mdash;He
      looked like you. I mean I ought to have known the name. Was he a
      relative?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My brother," Helen replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for a moment or two, and then went on in a tone that made
      Festing's heart beat: "You gave him work and helped him to make a new
      start. He was too proud to tell us about his difficulties."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It cost me nothing; there was a job waiting. Afterwards he got on by his
      own merits. I had nothing to do with that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you gave him his chance. We can't forget this. George was younger
      than me. I have no other brother, and was very fond of him. Indeed, I
      think we owe you much, and my mother is anxious to give you her thanks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he all right now? I lost sight of him when they sent me to another
      part of the road. It was my fault&mdash;he wrote, but I'm not punctual at
      answering letters, and hadn't much time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is in the chief construction office," Helen replied. "In his last
      letter he told us about the likelihood of his getting some new promotion."
      She paused and resumed with a smile: "I don't suppose you know you were a
      hero of his."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't know. As a rule, the young men we had on the road seemed to find
      their bosses amusing and rather patronized them. Of course, they were
      fresh from a scientific college or engineer's office, and, for the most
      part, we had learned what we knew upon the track."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you knew it well. George wrote long letters about the struggle you
      had at the canyon. Some fight, he called it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Festing quietly, "we were up against it then. The job was
      worth doing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know. George told us how the snowslide came down and filled the head of
      the gorge with stones and broken trees, and wash-outs wrecked the line you
      built along its side. He said it was a job for giants; clinging to the
      face of the precipice while you blew out and built on&mdash;under-pinning,
      isn't it?&mdash;the first construction track. But he declared the leaders
      were fine. They were where the danger was, in the blinding rain and
      swirling snow&mdash;and the boys, as he called them, would always follow
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing colored, but Helen went on: "We were glad, when the worst was
      over, that he had had this training. It was so clean a fight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We were dirty enough often," Festing objected with an effort at humor.
      "When things were humming we slept in our working clothes, which were
      generally stained with mud and engine grease. Then I don't suppose you
      know how dissipated a man looks and feels when he has breathed the fumes
      of giant-powder."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped him with a half imperious glance. "I know it's the convention
      to talk of such things as a joke; but you didn't feel that in the canyon.
      Then it was a stubborn fight of the kind that man was meant to wage. If
      you win in trade and politics, somebody must lose, but a victory over
      Nature is a gain to all. And when your enemies are storms and floods,
      cheating and small cunning are not of much use."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is so," Festing agreed, smiling. "When you're sent to cut through an
      icy rock or re-lay the steel across the gap a snowslide has made, it's
      obvious if you have done the job or not. This has some drawbacks, because
      if you don't make good, you often get fired."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that was not what drove you on. You must have had a better motive for
      making good."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing felt embarrassed. The girl was obviously not indulging a
      sentimental vein. She felt what she frankly hinted at, and although he
      generally avoided imaginative talk, her remarks did not sound cheap or
      ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said, "the fear of getting fired is a pretty strong incentive
      to do one's best, but I suppose when one gets up against big things there
      is something else. After all, one hates to be beaten."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen's eyes sparkled and she gave him a sympathetic nod. "The hate of
      being beaten distinguishes man from the ape and puts him on the side of
      the angels."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Miss Jardine came in, somewhat to the relief of Festing, who felt he
      could not keep up long on Helen's plane. Besides, he was not altogether
      sure he understood her last remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I heard," said Miss Jardine. "Helen's sometimes improving, but perhaps
      she was right just now. The ape is cunning but acquiescent and accepts
      things as they are. Man protests, and fights to make them better. At
      least, he ought to, though one can't say he always does."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing did not reply and she sat down and resumed: "But I suppose you
      haven't many shirkers in Canada?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I imagine we have as many wastrels as there are anywhere else, but as a
      rule one doesn't find them in the woods and on the plains. When they leave
      the cities they're apt to starve."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a grim lot. Work or starve is a stern choice, particularly if one
      has never done either. It looks as if you hadn't much use for purely
      ornamental people. But what about the half-taught women who don't know how
      to work? What do you do with them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're not numerous. Then one can always learn, and I imagine every
      woman can cook and manage a house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're taking much for granted, though yours seems to be the conventional
      view. But how did you learn railroad building, for example?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By unloading ties and shoveling ballast on the track. The trouble was
      that I began too late."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you do before that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes I worked in sawmills and sometimes packed&mdash;that means
      carrying things&mdash;for survey parties, and went prospecting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the wilds? It sounds interesting. Won't you tell us about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing complied; awkwardly at first, and then with growing confidence. He
      did not want to make much of his exploits, but there was a charm in
      talking about things he knew to two clever and attractive girls, and they
      helped him with tactful questions. Indeed, he was surprised to find they
      knew something about the rugged country in which he wandered. He told them
      about risky journeys up lonely rivers in the spring, adventurous thrusts
      into the wilderness where hardship was oftener to be found than valuable
      minerals, and retreats with provisions running out before the Arctic
      winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something of the charm of the empty spaces colored his narratives as he
      drew from memory half-finished pictures of the mad riot of primitive
      forces when the ice broke up and the floods hurled the thundering floes
      among the rocks; and of tangled woods sinking into profound silence in the
      stinging frost. Moreover, he unconsciously delineated his own character,
      and when he stopped, the others understood something of the practical
      resource and stubbornness that had supported him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was encouraging to see they were not bored, but he did not know that
      Miss Jardine had found him an interesting study and had skilfully led him
      on. He was a new type to both girls, although Helen was nearer to him than
      the other and sympathized where her companion was amused. Festing's ideas
      were clean-cut, his honesty was obvious, and she noted that he did not
      know much about the lighter side of life. Yet she saw that, sternly
      practical as he was, he had a vague feeling for romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you stay on the railroad when it's finished?" she asked presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've left it. I hadn't the proper training to carry me far, and as the
      road is opening up the country I've bought a prairie farm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But do you know much about farming?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't. As a matter of fact, not many of the boys do know much when they
      begin, but somehow they make progress. On the plains, it isn't what you
      know that counts, but the capacity for work and staying with your job.
      That's what one really needs, if you see what I mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I do," Miss Jardine replied. "A Victorian philosopher, whose
      opinions you seem to hold, said something of the kind. He claims that
      genius takes many different forms, but is not different in itself. That
      is, if you have talent, you can do what you like. Build railroads, for
      example, and then succeed on a farm."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing laughed good-humoredly. "It's a pretty big thing to claim, but
      that man was near the mark; they live up to his theories on the plains,
      where shams don't count and efficiency's the test. I don't mean that the
      boys have genius, but gift and perseverance seem to be worth as much.
      Anyhow, one can generally trust them to make good when they undertake a
      job they don't know much about."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen mused. Charnock, who knew something about farming, had tried it and
      failed, but she thought Festing would succeed. The man looked determined
      and, in a way, ascetic; he could deny himself and concentrate. Knowledge
      was not worth as much as character. But she was content to let Miss
      Jardine lead the talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One understands," said the latter, "that farming's laborious and not very
      profitable work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's always laborious," Festing agreed. "It may be profitable; that
      depends. You see&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on, using plain words but with some force of imagination, to
      picture the wheat-grower's hopes and struggles; but he did more, for as he
      talked Helen was conscious of the romance that underlay the patient
      effort. She saw the empty, silent land rolling back to the West; the
      ox-teams slowly breaking the first furrow, and then the big Percheron
      horses and gasoline tractors taking their place. Wooden shacks dotted the
      white grass, the belts of green wheat widened, wagons, and afterwards
      automobiles, lurched along the rutted trails. Then the railroad came,
      brick homestead and windmills rose, and cities sprang up, as it were, in a
      night. Everything was fluid, there was no permanence; rules and customs
      altered before they got familiar, a new nation, with new thoughts and
      aims, was rising from the welter of tense activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Festing got up with an apologetic air. "I'm afraid I've stopped too
      long and talked too much. Still the big movement out there is fascinating
      and people in this country don't grasp its significance. I felt I'd like
      to make you understand. Then you didn't seem&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If we had been bored, it would have been our fault, but we were not bored
      at all," Miss Jardine replied. "At least, I wasn't, and don't think Helen
      was."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen added her denial and gave Festing her hand. When he had gone Miss
      Jardine looked at her with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was interesting," she remarked. "Talks better than he knows, and I
      suppose we ought to feel flattered, because he took our comprehension for
      granted. After all, it was rash to talk about Canadian progress to two
      English girls."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You made him talk," Helen rejoined. "It's the first time I've known you
      interested in geography."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jardine laughed. "I was interested in the man. He told us a good deal
      about himself, although it would have embarrassed him if he'd guessed. The
      curious thing is that he imagines he's practical, while he's really a
      reckless sentimentalist."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen did not answer and picked up a book, but she thought more about
      Festing than about what she read.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      FESTING LOSES HIS TEMPER
    </h3>
    <p>
      Next morning Festing got breakfast early and set off down the dale. This
      was not the way Muriel had indicated, but he thought it better to avoid
      temptation. The girls had received him graciously at the farm and had
      perhaps listened with unusual patience, but if he overtook them in the
      morning the thing might look too marked. Besides, he doubted if it was
      advisable that Helen should see him again so soon, since he might remind
      her of matters she wished to forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      The self-denial cost him something, and he went down the dale
      irresolutely, stopping once or twice to look back. It was annoying to feel
      himself so weak, because he had seldom vacillated in Canada, but had
      chosen the proper line and then stuck to it. As a matter of fact, he had
      generally had a definite object and definite plans for its attainment.
      Although he had an object now, he was otherwise at a loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      He meant to marry Helen. Life was strenuous on the plains, and at first
      there might be hardships, but if she loved him she would not flinch. Her
      portrait had not done her justice; he dwelt upon her fearless confidence
      as she came down the screes, her light, sure step, and agile pose. These
      things indicated strength of mind and body, and he knew, if the need came,
      she would make good use of both.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by he thought of Charnock with keener anger than he had yet felt.
      Bob was a weak fool and something worse. He had broken the promise and
      then tricked his friend. The fellow's character was warped; he could not
      go straight, but tried to escape the consequences of his folly in a maze
      of crooked ways. The worst was that consequences could not be shirked. If
      the real offender avoided them, they fell upon somebody else, and now
      Festing had to pay. Bob had prejudiced him with Helen. She would probably
      never quite forget that he knew what she had suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he remembered that he had meant to spend a week or two in London, and
      made his way towards a valley through which a railway ran. Although he
      wanted to see Helen, he was half afraid, and imagined that the longer he
      waited the less risk he would run of his society jarring. Next day he left
      the hills, but did not greatly enjoy his visit to town. London was much
      like Montreal, where the buildings were as fine, only they did not dig up
      so many streets and fill the air with cement from the towering blocks of
      new offices. The English liked permanence, while the Canadians altered
      their cities from day to day. Besides he wanted to go back to the North as
      soon as it was prudent.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of his return it rained hard and he talked to Muriel in her
      drawing-room. He liked Muriel Gardiner and she frankly enjoyed his
      society. It did not matter that she sometimes seemed to find him amusing
      when he was serious. A fire burned in the grate, for the summer evening
      was cold, his low chair was comfortable, and Muriel, holding a fan to
      shield her face, sat opposite in the soft light of a shaded lamp that left
      much of the room in shadow. The circle of subdued illumination gave one a
      pleasant feeling of seclusion and made for mutual confidence, but Festing
      was silent for a time, thinking rather hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was getting used to English comforts, which did not seem so enervating
      as he had imagined, but he could give them up, and would, indeed, be
      forced to do so when he occupied his prairie homestead. A man could go
      without much that people in England required, and be the better for the
      self-denial, but it might be different for a girl. Long habit might make
      comfort and artistic surroundings actual necessities. It was, however,
      encouraging to remember Helen's cheerfulness as she led him among the
      crags in the rain. She had pluck and could bear fatigue and hardship.
      Besides, there need not be much hardship after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Muriel gave him a careless glance. "Helen told me she met you in
      the hills and you came over to the hall where she and Alison Jardine
      stopped. Now you have had an opportunity of correcting your first
      impression, what do you think of her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I have always thought," Festing replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muriel looked at him with surprise, and then laughed. "Oh, yes; I remember
      you saw her portrait first. Well, you have more imagination than I
      thought. But I understand you didn't see Helen again, although she and
      Alison went over part of the route I marked out for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing thought her manner was too careless, and felt suspicious, but he
      said: "I changed my plans. I thought it might look significant if I
      overtook the girls. One doesn't expect an accident to happen twice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you did the proper thing. But did you want to overtake them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did," said Festing quietly. "Still I felt I'd better not."
    </p>
    <p>
      Muriel was silent for a few moments, and then remarked: "Self-denial such
      as you practised deserves a reward, and I met Mrs. Dalton while you were
      away. She asked me to bring you over when you came back. I suppose you
      know what she wants?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Festing, who looked disturbed. "Do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Dalton told me. You helped George when he needed help, although he
      had no particular claim."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was ill and unfit for hard work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was that the only difficulty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see what you mean," said Festing, with some embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'll be frank. In what kind of company did you find the lad? You
      see, I know something about him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you insist, he'd got into bad hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was what I suspected, and I think Mrs. Dalton knows. George was not
      very steady when he was at home and got into some trouble before he left
      the office of a civil engineer. In fact, this was why he went to Canada."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I don't see what it has to do with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder whether you are as dull as you pretend. George is Mrs. Dalton's
      only son; although he had faults she and Helen are very fond of him. Now
      it would have been something if you had merely helped him out of a
      difficulty, but you did much more. You gave him his chance of making up
      for past follies. He has been steady ever since, and I understand is now
      getting on very well. It looks as if you had used some moral influence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't try," said Festing dryly, "I gave him his job and told him I'd
      have him fired if he shirked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You didn't consciously try, but it's possible to influence people without
      knowing. However, as Mrs. Dalton has too much tact to overwhelm you by her
      gratitude, you needn't be afraid of going to the Scar with me, although
      you seem to hesitate about meeting Helen."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing, who pondered for a few moments, felt that the girl was studying
      him. She had shown a rather embarrassing curiosity, but he though she
      meant to be his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you know Miss Dalton was in the mountains when you planned my walking
      tour?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did know," said Muriel with a direct glance. "Perhaps I was rash, but
      if so, I'm not afraid to own my fault. I suppose you understand why I sent
      you where I did?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In one way, your object's plain. For all that, I'm puzzled."
    </p>
    <p>
      Muriel smiled. "As Helen is my friend, you ought to be flattered. Doesn't
      it look as if I was satisfied with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll let that go. You took something for granted. I suppose you see you
      might have been mistaken about my feelings?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then no harm would have been done," Muriel rejoined, and putting down her
      fan, gave him a steady look. "Was I mistaken?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were not," said Festing quietly. "I mean to marry Miss Dalton if she
      is willing. I'm anxious to know what chance I've got."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't tell you that. Perhaps I have gone far enough; but George's
      reformation is a good certificate of your character, and Helen and her
      mother owe you a debt of gratitude."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing colored rather angrily. "My helping the lad was, so to speak, an
      accident; I don't want to be judged by this, and won't urge the debt. Miss
      Dalton must take me on my merits."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have pluck; it's a bold claim," said Muriel in a dry tone, and then
      got up as Gardiner and the curate came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day Festing went to the Scar, and when Mrs. Dalton received him she
      put her hand gently on his arm. She said enough, but not too much, and he
      was moved as he saw the moisture glisten in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't deserve this," he answered awkwardly. "I found the lad in some
      trouble, but hadn't to make much effort to help him out. In fact, it was
      the kind of thing one does without thinking and forgets."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Mrs. Dalton, "the consequences of one's deeds follow one,
      whether they're good or bad." Then she gave him a very friendly smile.
      "But perhaps we had better join the rest outside."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing found Helen in the garden with her aunt and some friends, but the
      others left them by and by, and they walked alone among the flowers. The
      day was calm, the light clear, and the shadow of the dark beeches on the
      hill crept slowly across the lawn. Beyond a low hedge, woods, smooth
      pastures, and fields of ripening corn rolled back and melted into the blue
      shadow beneath the rugged fells. It seemed to Festing that the peaceful
      sylvan landscape was touched by a glamour that centered in the fresh
      beauty of the girl. Sometimes they were silent, and sometimes they talked
      about the mountains, but when they went back to the house he thought they
      had got nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned to the Scar without Muriel a week later, and went again, and
      one evening stood with Helen on the terrace. Gentle rain had fallen for
      most of the day, but it had stopped, and a band of pale-saffron glimmered
      under heavy clouds in the West. Moisture dripped from the motionless
      branches and the air was hot. The lamps had just been lighted in the house
      and a yellow glow streamed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've stayed longer than I meant and forgot my lamp," Festing remarked.
      "However, this has happened before, and I hope I haven't stayed longer
      than I ought."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will let you go now," said Helen. "For one thing, I must get up
      early."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eight o'clock?" Festing suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Helen, smiling. "I am always up before, but it will be six
      o'clock to-morrow. I want to gather some mushrooms; they ought to be
      plentiful after a day like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is six o'clock a particularly suitable time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five o'clock might be better. If you don't go early, you often find that
      somebody has been round the fields first."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing asked where she expected to find the mushrooms, and when she told
      him said, "Very well; I'll meet you. It only means half an hour's journey
      on your fine English road; that is, if the bicycle holds up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why do you want to gather mushrooms?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to gather mushrooms. I really want to see you where I think
      you belong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the fields?" Helen suggested humorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Festing. "I don't mean in the fields. I've seen you in the
      afternoon when the sun's on the ripening corn and the leaves are dark and
      thick, but they stand for fulfilment, and that's not your proper setting.
      Once or twice I've stopped until evening, but you don't belong to the
      dusk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then where do I belong?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the sunrise, when the earth is fresh and the day is getting bright.
      Promise is your sign; fulfilment hasn't come."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen colored, and as she turned her head it struck her as portentous that
      she glanced towards the saffron streak that glimmered in the West. When
      she looked back, however, her face was calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" she said, "I wonder how and where the fulfilment will come!
      Sometimes I think of it and feel afraid; my life has been so smooth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't flinch if you have to bear some strain."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen gave him her hand. "Well, you must go now. I will expect you
      to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood looking towards the fading light for some time after his figure
      melted into the shadows on the drive. Her heart beat and she felt a
      thrill, for she admitted that the man had power to move her. As yet she
      would not ask herself how far his power went, but she knew the question
      must be answered soon. Other men had flattered her, and she had smiled,
      knowing what their compliments were worth, but she could not smile now.
      Then she roused herself and went in quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing met her next morning while the sun rose above the rounded masses
      of the beech wood, and entering a dewy pasture they skirted a fence
      half-smothered in briars. Both felt invigorated by the freshness of the
      morning and brushed across the sparkling grass, engaged in careless talk.
      By and by as Helen stooped to pick a mushroom a shrill scream came from
      beyond the fence, and she rose with an angry color in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" she said; "that spoils everything!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" Festing asked as the pitiful scream rose again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A rabbit, choking, in a snare," she answered with a look of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing leaped across a ditch and plunged into the briars. Helen heard the
      rotten fence-rails smash and he vanished behind the thorny branches that
      closed across the gap. She was glad he had gone so quickly; partly because
      it was her wish, and partly because she saw the cry of pain had moved him.
      She liked to think he was compassionate.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, Festing's pity was soon mixed with rage as he came
      upon a scene of barbarous cruelty. Three or four rabbits lay quiet upon
      the grass, but there were others that struggled feebly at his approach;
      their eyes protruding and strangling wires cutting into their throats. He
      thought they were past his help, but one rolled round with half-choked
      screams and he ran to it first. It was difficult to hold the struggling
      animal while he opened the thin brass noose, but he set it free, and it
      lay paralyzed with fear for a few moments before it ran off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he released the others as gently as he could. Their dew-draggled
      bodies felt cold and limp and the wire had bitten deep into the swollen
      flesh. Two, however, feebly crawled away and he carried another to the
      mouth of a burrow, after which he wiped the dew and blood from his hands,
      while his lips set in a firm line. He hoped he was not a sentimentalist,
      and admitted that man must kill to eat; moreover he had used the rifle in
      the Northern wilds. Once a hungry cinnamon bear had raided the camp, and
      he remembered a certain big bull moose. That was clean sport, for a man
      who faced such antagonists must shoot quick and straight, but this
      torturing of small defenseless creatures revolted him. Still he admitted
      that it might not have done so quite so much but for the pain it caused
      the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen glanced at him with some surprise when he went back to the fence.
      She had not seen him look like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've let them go, but two or three are dead," he remarked. "I suppose
      they've been lying there all night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid so. They come out to feed at dusk. It's horribly cruel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's devilish! Why don't you stop it? Is the field yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It goes with the house, and when we let the grazing I stipulated that no
      snares should be laid, but there was some mistake and the tenant claimed
      the rabbits. We said he could shoot them, and I understand he's disputing
      with the agent. But where are you going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going back to finish the job; these particular snares won't be used
      again. If you like, I'll come over every evening and pull the blamed
      things up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think that will be necessary," Helen answered with a strained
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt disturbed and excited when Festing turned away. Her life had been
      smooth and she did not think she had seen a man seized by savage anger;
      certainly not a man she knew. Festing was angry, and no doubt justly, but
      at the Scar the primitive vein in human nature was decently hidden. Now
      she did not know if she were jarred or not. Then she heard voices, and
      going nearer the fence, tried to see through the briars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing, with a pocket-knife and some brass wire in his hand, confronted a
      big slouching man who carried a heavy stick and a net bag. Bits of fur
      stuck to the fellow's clothes and there was blood on his dirty hands. A
      half-grown lad with another stick waited, rather uneasily, in the
      background.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What might you be doing?" the man inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm cutting up your snares," Festing replied. "What have you got to say
      about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The other gave him a slow, sullen look. "Only that you'd better leave the
      snares alone. How many rabbits?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Four," said Festing, pulling up another snare and cutting the noose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then that will be five shillings. I'll say nothing about the snares;
      wire's cheap."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing laughed. "It's a dead bluff. Light out of this field before I put
      you off."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man hesitated, his eyes fixed on Festing's hardset face. Perhaps a way
      out might have been found, but the lad precipitated matters. Running to
      the mouth of the burrow, he picked up a half-dead rabbit that was trying
      to crawl away, and leered at Festing as he raised his stick. The blow was
      not struck, for Festing leaped across the grass and next moment the boy
      fell beside the burrow. He was unhurt, but too surprised to move, because
      he had never seen anybody move as fast as the man who threw him down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Festing heard steps behind, and turned in time to guard his head with
      his right arm. It felt numb and he was half dazed by a shock of pain, but
      he struck savagely with his left hand and his knuckles jarred on bone. The
      other's stick dropped, and when they grappled Festing was relieved to feel
      his arm was not broken. His muscles were hard and well trained, his blood
      was hot, and a struggle of the kind was not altogether a novelty. When
      liquor is smuggled into a construction camp, a section boss must sometimes
      use physical force or relinquish his command.
    </p>
    <p>
      He staggered and nearly fell as his leg was seized. It looked as if the
      lad had come to his master's help; but one could not be fastidious, and a
      savage backward kick got rid of the new antagonist. The other was powerful
      and stubborn, and Festing spent a strenuous few minutes before he threw
      him into the sand beside the burrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm pretty fresh and ready to start again if you are," he said. "Still I
      reckon you have had enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      The fellow got up scowling and told the lad to bring his bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll hear more about this," he rejoined and slouched off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing went back, and Helen started when he jumped across the ditch. His
      jacket was torn, his lip was cut, and his face was bruised. He looked
      dishevelled, but not at all embarrassed. In fact, there was a gleam of
      half-humorous satisfaction in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The snares are all cut up," he said. "I broke the fellow's stick and
      threw away the pegs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen felt a strange desire to laugh. There was something ridiculous in
      his nave triumph, but she was not really amused. In fact, her confused
      sensations were puzzling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you hurt him?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so," said Festing. "I rather think I did and don't expect he'll
      come back while I'm about. However, as I can't come here as often as I'd
      like, it might be better to see your agent. In the meantime, we'll look
      for some mushrooms."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But don't you want to bathe your face?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I forgot that I probably look the worse for wear," said Festing, who
      wiped his cut lip. "Still if I met your mother, she might get a shock, and
      now I come to think of it, I'm no doubt jarring you, so I'll go off and
      see your agent if you'll tell me where he lives."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's some distance, and we don't do things so quickly here. I must talk
      to my mother first. Besides, the agent may not have got up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'll sit on the doorstep. But what is there to talk about? You don't
      want your rabbits tortured so that somebody may make thirty cents apiece.
      It has got to be stopped, and why not stop it now? Where does the fellow
      live?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen told him, and added: "But you can't go like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I suppose not," said Festing doubtfully. "It won't make a long round
      if I call at Gardiner's. I'll come back later and tell you how I've fixed
      things up."
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his badly crushed hat, and when he turned away Helen laughed, a
      half-hysterical laugh. His fierce energy had, so to speak, left her
      breathless; she was shaken by confused emotions. It was for her sake he
      had plunged into the quarrel, but she felt disturbed by his savageness.
      For all that, something in her approved, and it was really this that
      troubled her. Picking up the basket, she crossed the field with a very
      thoughtful look.

      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HELEN DECIDES
    </h3>
    <p>
      Some weeks had passed since Festing went to gather mushrooms when he sat,
      one evening, on the terrace in front of Gardiner's house. His brows were
      knit and he had in his had a letter from Kerr at the construction camp.
      The back of the letter was covered with penciled calculations, but he
      presently put it down and looked moodily about.
    </p>
    <p>
      The larches that sheltered the house had been in full leaf when he came,
      but now they were getting bare. One could see the hills through a fine
      network of twigs, dotted with minute tassels of gold. The beeches and oaks
      looked solid yet, but the former shone warm brown and red against the
      others' fading green. Withered leaves fluttered down, and the smell of a
      burning heap hung in the damp air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The touches of brown and gold in the landscape hinted that time was
      passing. Winter was already advancing across the wastes of Northern Canada
      and the geese and ducks were flying south. Festing heard in fancy the
      brant's changing cry that always filled him with unrest, but the letter in
      his hand was a clearer call. Kerr had offered him a contract for hauling a
      quantity of telegraph posts and logs across the snow, and his calculations
      indicated that the work ought to be profitable. It would keep him occupied
      all winter; one could buy horses cheap when harvest was over and sell them
      advantageously when plowing began in the spring. Besides, the money he
      earned would help him to stock his farm and furnish his homestead well.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had loitered in England long enough. He would never forget this
      holiday, for he had learned what happiness life might have in store; but
      it was a happiness that could not be attained by romantic dreams. He must
      earn it by tense effort, and was willing to pay the price; this was the
      reason he must get back to work. For all that, he had doubts, and was glad
      when Muriel came along the terrace and sat down on the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You look unusually thoughtful," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have something to think about. I find I must go back to Canada very
      soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Muriel made an abrupt movement. "You are going away! But we thought&mdash;"
      She paused and resumed: "Does Helen know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet; I must tell her. It will cost me something to leave, but I've
      got to go. Perhaps you had better see what Kerr has to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave her the letter, and after waiting until she had read it, went on:
      "I can't let this chance pass; I want the money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I understand," said Muriel. "Still you haven't told me much."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for a few moments and looked very grave, but she had for
      some time imagined that he was bearing a strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said, "I'm up against things and can't see my way. That is, I
      do see where I mean to go, but don't know if I ought."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The problem's not exactly new. However, if you will state it clearly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll try," said Festing. "One can trust you; in fact, I wanted to tell
      you before."
    </p>
    <p>
      He explained his difficulties, practical and moral, and when he finished
      Muriel said: "It comes to this&mdash;You are in love with Helen and mean
      to marry her, but hesitate because you fear she may find the life too
      hard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a big risk for an English girl. She must give up everything, while I
      have all to gain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But suppose she were willing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The trouble is that she doesn't know what she may have to bear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Muriel smiled. "It's a risk that many girls must run. But after all it
      depends upon what she values most."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comfort, leisure, refined friends, and other things you enjoy here are
      worth much to a girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All this is true," Muriel agreed, and pausing, continued with a blush:
      "Still these things don't satisfy every need, and perhaps my example may
      be some encouragement. Fred isn't very clever and will probably never be
      rich, but I'd sooner face poverty with him than marry a prince."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing bowed. "Thank you for that! Fred's a very good sort. I knew you
      had pluck."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really think Helen is pluckier and stronger than me. But I imagine you
      have already made up your mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have; for all that, I'm afraid. If I have bad luck, Helen will have to
      pay. I know she was willing to marry Charnock, but she was very young then
      and he was rich compared with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I suppose a little money would be a useful help?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would, in one way," Festing agreed. "The trouble is that I haven't
      much; only enough to make a fair start if I'm economical."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Muriel looked amused, but her seriousness returned. "We'll
      let that go. You seem to forget that you don't stand alone. I should have
      found it hard to forgive Fred if he had decided whether he ought to marry
      or not, without consulting me. It's a girl's right, not her lover's, to
      say what she values most and how much she is willing to bear. If Helen
      loves you, she's entitled to be given the choice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Festing, "I don't know if she loves me yet!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Muriel's eyes twinkled. "That is something you must find out for yourself.
      But perhaps I have said enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went back to the house and Festing sat still in the gathering dark. He
      had made up his mind and felt encouraged, but he saw difficulties that
      must be met.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day he went to the Scar and found that Helen was not at home, but
      Mrs. Dalton and her sister received him, and for a time he talked about
      things that did not matter. It was dull and damp outside, and a bright
      wood fire burned in the grate. The low-ceilinged room was very warm, its
      comfort seemed enervating, and he felt braced as he thought of the
      windswept prairie. Then he knew his remarks were vague and disconnected.
      It was a relief to plunge into the business he had come about.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had better tell you that I am going to ask Helen to marry me," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dalton did not look surprised, and he thought Miss Graham smiled.
      Perhaps he had been abrupt, but he did not care.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have done what is proper in warning my sister first," Miss Graham
      remarked; but Mrs. Dalton was silent for a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You imply that Helen doesn't know," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She does not; I've been careful not to give her a hint," Festing
      declared. "I was afraid to alarm her by, so to speak, rushing things.
      You're not used to it in England."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Graham's amusement was plainer. "The caution you exercised must have
      cost you something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all, you haven't known Helen long," Mrs. Dalton resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so, in a way, but five minutes was long enough. I knew I'd never
      marry anybody else when I saw her in the garden the first day I came."
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought Miss Graham gave him an approving look, but he turned to Mrs.
      Dalton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you will give your consent; but, of course, if you object, or
      there's anything you want to ask&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dalton roused herself. She felt breathless, as if she had been
      carried along at an unusual pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To begin with," she said quietly, "I cannot object to you. We know
      something about your character; you helped my son, helped him more than
      you perhaps thought. But there is something I must ask." She hesitated and
      then resumed: "You have seen the life Helen leads with us. She has never
      had to use much self-denial. What have you to offer her in Canada?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not much. In fact, that's partly why I came first to you. I felt you
      should be warned; that's really what I meant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are honest," Miss Graham interposed. "You want my sister's approval,
      but don't think it essential."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing looked at Mrs. Dalton. "If you refused, I wouldn't be altogether
      daunted. I might wait, but that is all. This is a matter Helen must
      decide."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. All the same, it is my duty to guard her from a possible mistake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; I'll make matters as plain as I can. To begin with, I haven't
      much money, and although I'm building a good homestead, a Western farm is
      very different from the Scar. There's none of the refinement you have
      round you; a man must work from sunrise until it's dark, and there are
      many demands upon a woman. For all that, I can guard against Helen
      suffering actual hardship. In fact, she shall suffer nothing I can save
      her from. It's the pressure of things one can't control and her own
      character that may cause the strain. If I know her, she won't stand by and
      watch when there's much that ought to be done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She would not. But how long do you expect the strain to last?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not very long. Two years, three years; I can't tell. When you break new
      land you work hard and wait. The railroad throws out branches, elevators
      are built, small towns spring up, and while you improve your holding
      comfort and often prosperity comes to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But in the meantime a little capital would help?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," said Festing. "The trouble is I haven't much, but I think I
      have enough to provide all that's strictly necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought Mrs. Dalton gave her sister a warning glance, but she said:
      "Well, you have my consent to ask Helen; but if she is willing to run the
      risk, there is a stipulation I must make."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So long as you consent, I'll agree to anything," Festing declared. "I
      can't repay you for your trust, but I'll try to deserve it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dalton told him where Helen had gone, and setting off to meet her, he
      presently saw her come round a bend in a lane. The sun had set and tall
      oaks, growing along the hedgerows, darkened the lane, but a faint crimson
      glow from the west shone between the trunks. To the east, the quiet
      countryside rolled back into deepening shadow. For a moment Festing
      hesitated as he watched the girl advance. It was rash to uproot this fair
      bloom of the sheltered English garden and transplant it in virgin soil,
      swept by the rushing winds. Then he went forward resolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen gave him her hand and moved on with disturbed feelings, for there
      was something different in his look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you don't mind, we'll stop a minute; I have something to say. To begin
      with, I'm going back to Canada."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up sharply and then waited with forced calm until he resumed:
      "That precipitates matters, because I must learn if I've hoped for too
      much before I go. I was a stranger when I came here, and you were kind&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were not a stranger," Helen said quietly. "George told us about you,
      and for his sake&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want you to be kind for George's sake, but my own. I'd sooner you
      liked me for what I am, with all my faults."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it's any comfort, I think I really do like you," Helen admitted with a
      strained smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well enough to marry me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen colored, but gave him a level glance. "Ah," she said, "aren't you
      rash? You hardly know me yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not rash at all; I knew you long ago. Your portrait hung in
      Charnock's house and I used to study it on winter nights. It told me what
      you were, and when I saw you under the copper beech I knew you very well.
      Still now I have seen you, your picture had lost its charm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you have it?" Helen asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing gave her a Russia leather case and her face flushed red.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did Bob give you this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Festing quietly; "I stole it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the case?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The case was made in Montreal. I went to Winnipeg, but could get nothing
      good enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen turned her head. It was a long way to Winnipeg from the prairie
      bridge, and she was moved that he had made the journey to find a proper
      covering for her picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must have valued the portrait," she remarked shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did, but it won't satisfy me now. As soon as I met you I fell in love
      with you. Somehow I think you must have seen&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Helen quietly, "I did see."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing summoned his self-control. "You must know what you decide. I must
      live in Canada; my homestead may seem rude and bare after your mother's
      beautiful house, and I tried to show you what a prairie farm is like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I know," Helen said, and gave him a quick tender look. "Still,
      such things don't really matter&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Festing stepped forward and took her in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later he sat talking to Mrs. Dalton and Miss Graham in the
      drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad you have agreed to wait and come back for Helen in the spring,
      but I ought to tell you something now, because it may make a difference in
      your plans," Mrs. Dalton remarked "You admitted that some of the
      difficulties you and Helen would have to meet might be avoided if you had
      a little more capital."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would certainly make a difference, but I have got no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Helen has some money," Mrs. Dalton replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing knitted his brows. "I didn't suspect this!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is obvious," Miss Graham interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing got up, moved a pace or two, and stopped. "How much has she got?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dalton told him and he frowned. "Then she had better keep it. I'd
      sooner you tied it up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't that unreasonable?" Miss Graham asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a man's business to support his wife. I don't want to live on
      Helen's money. Besides, I've made my plans."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think you quite understand," Mrs. Dalton rejoined. "After all, it
      is not a large sum and can be used for Helen's benefit. It may save her
      from some discomfort and give her advantages you could not provide."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing pondered for a few moments, and then answered thoughtfully: "Yes,
      I see this, and can't refuse. Well, perhaps the safest way would be to
      transfer the land I bought to Helen and record it in her name. It's bound
      to go up in value and couldn't be taken from her unless she borrowed on a
      mortgage. The arrangement would set free my capital and enable us to run
      the homestead on more comfortable lines." Then he paused and asked: "Did
      Charnock know about the money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He did not," said Mrs. Dalton. "We thought it better not to tell him; but
      we can trust you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Festing, who was silent for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had wondered whether he had misjudged Charnock in one respect, but saw
      that he had not. The fellow was a cur and would not have married Sadie if
      he had known about Helen's money. But this did not matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he resumed, "if you agree to my proposition, we'll get a lawyer to
      fix it up. In a way, it's some relief to know Helen has enough, and now
      I'm going to talk to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      He found her in the next room and she gave him a smile. "I expect mother
      has told you I'm not as poor as you thought. Are you pleased or not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm pleased for your sake, because there's not much risk of your finding
      things too hard, but I'd have been proud to marry you if you had nothing
      at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not even a certain prettiness?" Helen asked.
    </p>

      "Your beauty's something to be thankful for; but after all it's, so to
      speak, an accident, like your money. It wasn't your beauty, but you, I
      fell in love with."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen blushed. "Ah!" she said, "now you're very nice indeed!"

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      SADIE USES PRESSURE
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was getting cold in the small back office when Sadie put down her pen
      and went into the store. She was cramped with sitting, for she had been
      occupied with accounts for several hours and the stove had burned low.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can quit now, Steve," she said to the clerk. "Put out the lights, but
      don't lock up. I'm going to wait until the boss comes."
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk turned his head to hide a smile; because he knew where Charnock
      was, and thought Mrs. Charnock might have to wait some time; but he did as
      he was told, and when he went out Sadie stood shivering at the door. She
      had married Charnock late in the fall and now it was March, but there was
      no sign yet of returning spring. The sky was dark and a bitter wind from
      the prairie blew down the empty street. Blocks of square-fronted houses
      stood out harshly against the snow, which sparkled here and there in a ray
      of light. The settlement looked ugly and very desolate, and Sadie studied
      it with a feeling of weariness and disgust. It seemed strange that she had
      once thought it a lively place, but this was before she met Charnock, who
      had taught her much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shutting the door, she returned to the office and glanced critically at
      her reflection in a mirror on the wall. She had been ill, in consequence
      of the strain she had borne while her father was sick, and looked older.
      Her face was thin and she felt tired, but her skin had not lost its silky
      whiteness, and her black dress hung in becoming lines. It was a well-cut
      dress, for Sadie was extravagant in such matters and knew how to choose
      her clothes. She had lost the freshness that had marked her, but had
      gained something: a touch of dignity that she thought of as style.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting down at the desk, she began to muse. Keller had fallen ill soon
      after her wedding. It was a painful illness, and as skilled help was
      scarce, she had nursed him until he died. He was a plain storekeeper, but
      she knew he was, in many ways, a bigger and better man than Bob. He
      demanded all that was his, but he kept his word, and when he undertook a
      thing put it over, which Bob seldom did. Shortly before he died he gave
      Sadie good advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You got the man you wanted, and now it's your job to look after him. head
      him off the liquor, and keep your hands on the dollars. I've fixed things
      so's they belong to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Another time he asked for certain accounts, and after studying them
      remarked: "You want to watch the business and run it all it's worth. You
      have a husband to work for now, and I guess a man like Bob comes
      expensive. Still, if you can guild him right, he's not all a fool."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie had not resented this. She knew it was true, and her father had not
      meant to sneer. He was a blunt man and generally talked like that, and
      Sadie sometimes did so. Well, she had not been cheated, because she knew
      what Bob was before they married; and although ambition had something to
      do with it, she loved him. For all that, she had got some rude jars, and
      now passion was dying, her love was colored by a certain half-maternal
      protection. Bob must be watched and guarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her ambition, however, remained. She had beauty and intelligence and
      wanted to win a place in cultured society. Bob could help her, and she was
      tired of the dreary settlement. But she was practical. Money would be
      needed if they were to move to one of the cities, and although trade was
      good, gathering dollars was slow work when one had an extravagant husband.
      While she had been ill Bob was left in charge of the business, and on
      recovering her first task had been to find out how he had managed. Now she
      had found out and got something of a shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room got colder, but Bob had made some entries in a cash-book she
      could not understand, and opening the book again, she spent some time in
      calculations that threw no fresh light on the matter. Then she heard steps
      and turned as Charnock came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took off his fur-coat and Sadie frowned as he dropped it into a dusty
      corner. It was an expensive coat, but one could not teach Bob to take care
      of things. Then he kissed her and sat down on the edge of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're getting prettier, Sadie; that thoughtful look of yours is
      particularly fetching. But I can see you're tired. Put those books away
      and let's get home."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie knew what his compliments were worth, although they had not lost
      their charm. He wanted to put things off, but she must be firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You make me tired, and I haven't finished with the books. We've got to
      have a talk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like you best when you don't talk; you sometimes say too much,"
      Charnock replied. "Besides a girl like you ought to be satisfied with
      being seen. You're worth looking at."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie gave him a quick glance. He had recently become fastidious about his
      clothes and she did not grudge the dollars he spent on them. His taste was
      good, and he looked very graceful as he turned to her with a smile on his
      face. The hint of dissipation it had worn was not so marked, for she had
      some power over him and used it well, but she thought he had been
      indulging. There was, however, no use in getting angry with Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were at Wilkinson's again," she said. "You promised you'd stop off
      going there. I suppose he set up the whisky!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't take much. It wasn't good whisky; not like ours. That reminds me&mdash;I'm
      not much of a business man, but I've had a happy thought. My notion is we
      give the boys better liquor than they want. They wouldn't know the
      difference if we kept cheaper stuff."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie frowned, because she had accepted her father's business code. His
      charges were high, but it had been his boast that Keller's delivered the
      goods one paid for. Then she realized that Bob had nearly succeeded in
      putting off the threatened talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she said, "that's bad business in the end. When you'd had some
      whisky, Wilkinson got out the cards?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well, you know you stopped me playing a quiet game at home, and three
      or four of the boys were there. Then a Brandon real-estate man asked for
      the cards."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much were you out when you finished the game?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not much," said Charnock with some hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you insist, about ten dollars."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie made a gesture of impatience, but after all he might have had a
      heavier loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ten dollars and a headache next morning for an evening's card game. You
      surely don't know much, Bob! But look at this statement and tell me where
      the money's gone."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock took the paper she gave him and colored.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never thought it was as much as that. Upon my word, I didn't!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's it gone?" Sadie demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been unlucky," said Charnock, who began a confused explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had heard of a building lot on the outskirts of Winnipeg, to which he
      had been told a new street line would run. He had paid for a time option
      on the site, and now it appeared that the trolley scheme had been
      abandoned. Then somebody had given him a hint about a deal in grain that
      the speculators could not put over. It looked a safe snap and he had sold
      down, but the market had gone up and his margin was exhausted. When he
      stopped, Sadie's eyes flashed scornfully, but she controlled her anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a fool, Bob; you never learn," she said wearily. "Anyhow, you have
      got to cut out this kind of thing; the business won't stand for it long.
      Well, as you can't be trusted with dollars, I'll have to put you on an
      allowance. I hate to be mean, but if you waste what I give you, you'll get
      no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock's face got red. "This is rather a nasty knock. Not that I want
      your money, but the thing's humiliating."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think it isn't humiliating to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps it is," said Charnock, with a half-ashamed look. "I admit I have
      been something of an ass, but you are mean, in a sense. What are you going
      to do with your money, if you don't intend to spend it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Use if for making more; anyhow, until I get enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When will you have enough?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I can sell out the business and live where I want; give you the
      friends you ought to have instead of low-down gamblers and whisky-tanks.
      If you'd take hold and work, Bob, we'd be rich in a few years. The boys
      like you, you could do all the trade, and the boom that's beginning will
      make this settlement a big place. But I guess there's no use in talking&mdash;and
      I'm ill and tired."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie's pose got slack and she leaned her arms on the table with her face
      in her hands. Charnock, feeling penitent, tried to comfort her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a very good sort, Sadie, and mean well; I'll go steady and try not
      to bother you again. But we won't say any more about it now. Are those new
      letters? The mail hadn't come when I left."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him two envelopes, and after reading part of the first letter he
      started and the paper rustled in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter?" she asked. "Have you lost some money I don't know
      about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't," Charnock answered with a hoarse laugh. "The letter's from
      some English friends. You head that Festing had gone back to the Old
      Country. Well, he's going to be married soon and will bring his wife out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know her? Who is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I know her very well. She's Helen Dalton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The girl you ought to have married!" Sadie exclaimed. "What's she like? I
      guess you have her picture, though you haven't shown it me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had one, but haven't now. I meant to burn the thing, but suspect that
      Festing stole it. Confound him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie was silent for a few moments and then gave Charnock a searching
      look. "Anyhow, I don't see why that should make you mad. You let her go
      and took me instead. Do you reckon she'd have been as patient with you as
      I am?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Charnock, rather drearily. "Helen isn't patient, and I dare say
      I'd have broken her heart. You have done your best for me, and I expect
      you find it a hopeless job. For all that, I never thought Festing&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's done with," Sadie rejoined quietly, although there was some color in
      her face. "If the girl likes Festing, what has it to do with you? Besides,
      as he has located some way back from the settlement, there's no reason you
      should meet him or his wife." Then she frowned and got up. "But the place
      is very cold; we'll go home."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock put out the light and locked the door, but he was silent as they
      walked across the snow to the hotel, and Sadie wondered what he thought.
      There was no doubt he was disturbed, or he would have tried to coax her
      into abandoning her resolution to put him on an allowance. She meant to be
      firm about this.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next two or three weeks Charnock occupied himself with his duties
      and everything went smoothly at the store and hotel. He was popular in the
      neighborhood, since his weaknesses were rather attractive than repellent
      to people who did not suffer from them. Men who drove long distances from
      their lonely farms liked a cheerful talk and to hear the latest joke;
      others enjoyed a game of cards in the back office when Mrs. Charnock was
      not about. Besides, it was known that Keller's was straight; one got full
      weight and value when one dealt there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trade, moreover, was unusually good. Settlers looking for land filled the
      hotel, and now elevators were to be built, farmers hired extra labor and
      broke new soil. Household supplies were purchased on an unprecedented
      scale, and when snow melted the hotel stables were occupied by
      rough-coated teams, while wagons, foul with the mud of the prairie trails,
      waited for their loads in front of the store. Sadie felt cheered and
      encouraged, and although Bob sometimes spent in careless talk an hour or
      two that might have been better employed, she was willing to make up for
      his neglect by extra work in the office at night. He was doing well and
      she began to be hopeful.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, however, when there were goods to be entered and bills
      written out, he went home for supper and did not come back. Sadie stopped
      in the office long after the clerk had gone, but when she put down her pen
      the stove was out and she was surprised to find how late it was. She felt
      tired and annoyed, for she had been busily occupied since morning, and
      suspected that Bob was telling amusing stories while she did his work.
      Then in shutting up the store she forgot her rubber over-shoes, and the
      sidewalk was plastered with sticky mud. She wore rather expensive slippers
      and thought they would be spoiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock was not about when she entered the hotel, and the guests seemed
      to have gone to bed. The light was out in the office, and the big lounge
      room, where lumps of half-dry mud lay upon the board floor, was
      unoccupied. The bell-boy, who was using a brush amidst a cloud of dust,
      said he did not think the boss had gone upstairs, and with sudden
      suspicion Sadie entered a dark passage that led to a room where commercial
      travelers showed their goods. She opened the door and stopped just inside,
      her head tilted back and an angry sparkle in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was very hot and smelt of liquor, tobacco, and kerosene; the lamp
      had been turned too high and its cracked chimney was black. Charnock and
      three others sat round a table on which stood a bottle and four glasses.
      One of the glasses had upset and there was a pool, bordered by soaked
      cigar-ash, on the boards. The men were playing cards, and a pile of paper
      money indicated that the stakes were high. Sadie knew them all and deeply
      distrusted one, whom she suspected of practising on her husband's
      weaknesses; she disliked another, and the third did not count. She looked
      up rather awkwardly, and she saw that Charnock had taken too much liquor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good evening, boys," she said. "I want to lock the doors, and guess you
      don't know how late it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson, the man she distrusted, took out his watch. He had a horse
      ranch some distance off, and the farmers called him a sport. As a matter
      of fact, he was a successful petty gambler, but generally lost his
      winnings by speculating in real-estate and wheat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's surely late, Mrs. Charnock," he agreed. "Still, I dare say you can
      give us a quarter of an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five minutes," Sadie answered. "You can cut the game you're playing when
      you like. I'm tired, but I'll wait."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson looked at Charnock, but stopped arranging his cards. "Well, I'm
      ready to quit. Bob's made a scoop the last few deals, and I reckon I've
      not much chance of getting my money back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go 'way, Sadie; go 'way right now!" Charnock interrupted. "You gotta put
      up a fair game, and I can't stop when I've all the boys' dollars in my
      pocket."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie was sometimes tactful, but her anger was quick, and she disliked to
      hear her husband use Western idioms. Moreover she expected him to be
      polite.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," she said, "I guess that's a change; your dollars are generally in
      their wallets. But this game has to stop."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mossup, the man she did not like, turned in his chair. He was not sober
      and his manners were not polished at the best of times. He sold small
      tools and hardware for a Winnipeg wholesale firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, you might call a bell-boy. That whisky's rank; I want a different
      drink."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock got up with an awkward movement, but Sadie did not want his help.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drinks are served in the bar and the bar is shut," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm stopping here; I hired this room, and as long as I pay it's mine.
      We're not in Manitoba, and I guess the law&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie silenced him imperiously. She understood his reference to Manitoba,
      where regulations dealing with liquor are strictly enforced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I make the law at Keller's, and this hotel is not a gambling saloon. Mr.
      Wilkinson, cork that bottle and put it on the shelf."
    </p>
    <p>
      As Wilkinson obeyed, Mossup put his hand on his arm to hold him back, but
      Charnock interfered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You sit down right now. Understand, everybody, what Mrs. Charnock says
      goes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," Wilkinson agreed. "Get off to bed Mossup; you'll have a
      swelled head all right to-morrow, as it is. I'll put out the light, Mrs.
      Charnock; guess I'll do it better than Bob."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think I can't put out a common old lamp?" Charnock inquired. "Destroy the
      blamed thing 'fore I let it beat me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're not going to try," said Wilkinson, who hustled him and Mossup out
      of the room and then held the door open for Sadie.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thanked him, but felt that if she had ground to fear resentment, it
      was not Mossup's but his. Wilkinson had manners, but she knew he did not
      like to be robbed of an easy victim, and it was possible that he had let
      Bob win until he was drunk enough to be fleeced. She waited a few moments
      to let the others go, and then went upstairs and stopped in a passage that
      led to her room. Her face was hot and she breathed fast, for her part in
      the scene had cost her something. It would have been different had
      Charnock not been there; she could have dealt with the others, but he had
      made her ashamed. Then she heard his step and turned with passionate anger
      as he came along the passage. He stopped and looked at her with drunken
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By George, you're a fine thing, Sadie! Handsomest and pluckiest woman in
      the township!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie said nothing, but her pose stiffened and her lips set tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look your best when you're angry," Charnock went on. "Not quite so
      'tractive, too pale and want animation, when you're calm."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer, but felt a quiver of repulsion. His voice was thick,
      his eyes had a stupid amorous look, and he smelt of whisky. Sadie was not
      remarkably fastidious; she had, for several years, managed a hotel, and
      had used her physical charm to attract the man, but she was jarred. As
      yet, she made no appeal to the better side of Bob's nature, if it had a
      better side, and his sensual admiration revolted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock felt puzzled and somewhat daunted, but tried to put his arm round
      her waist. Sadie seized his shoulders and pushed him violently back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you touch me, you drunken hog!" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed at her in dull surprise and then braced himself. Sadie had moods,
      but generally came round if he made love to her. Besides, although she was
      in one of her rages, her attitude was irresistibly inciting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm your husband anyhow. Now don't be a silly little fool&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew back as he advanced and picked up a mop. It was used for
      polishing board floors and had a long handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're my husband when you're sober; I didn't marry a whisky-tank. If you
      touch me, Bob, I'll knock you down!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock stopped. When Sadie spoke like that she meant what she said. She
      looked at him steadily for a moment or two, and then put down the mop and
      turned away. He durst not follow, and when she entered a room close by, he
      shrugged with half-bewildered resignation and stumbled off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie, leaning with labored breath against the rail of her bed, heard him
      fall down the three or four steps in the middle of the passage and
      afterwards get up and go on again. Then she laughed, a strained,
      hysterical laugh.

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE SACRIFICE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Charnock hesitated about meeting Sadie at breakfast, but found her calm
      and apparently good-humored. He felt embarrassed and his head ached, but
      she made him some strong coffee in a way he liked. Sadie did not often
      sulk, and he was grateful because she said nothing about what had happened
      on the previous night. Indeed, he was on the point of telling her so, but
      her careless manner discouraged him and he resolved instead that he would
      stop gambling and keep as steady as he could. After all, Sadie was really
      treating him well; she might, for example, have stopped his getting
      liquor. He meant to brace up and give her no more trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept his resolve for a fortnight, and then, one morning, a man brought
      him a note from Wilkinson, asking him to drive over to the range. Charnock
      told the man he could not go, but presently put down his pen and looked
      out of the open window of the office of the store. The last of the snow
      had vanished some time since, and round white clouds drifted across the
      sky. Flying shadows streaked the wide plain, which gleamed like silver in
      the sunshine, and the bleached grass rolled in long waves before the
      breeze. There was something strangely exhilarating in the air and the
      dusty office smelt of salt-pork and cheese. It was a glorious day for a
      drive, he need not stay long at Wilkinson's, and the team needed exercise.
      Moreover, Sadie was not about and would not come home until afternoon; he
      might get back before her. He hesitated for a few minutes and then sent an
      order to the stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight he had not returned, and Sadie sat in the office at the hotel,
      making futile efforts to fix her attention on a newspaper. The guests had
      gone to bed and the building was very quiet, but she had kept the ostler
      up. He might be needed and she could trust him not to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length she heard the sound she listened for. A beat of hoofs and rattle
      of wheels came down the street. It was their team, she knew their trot,
      but she wondered anxiously whether Bob was driving. When the rig stopped
      she went to the door, where the ostler stood with a lantern, and caught
      her breath as Wilkinson got down. There was nobody else on the seat of the
      light wagon, and Charnock had set off with a different rig.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's Bob?" she asked in a strained voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We put him inside," said Wilkinson. "He wasn't quite able to sit up. I'd
      have kept him all night only that I reckoned you might be scared."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie, putting her foot on the wheel when the ostler held up the light,
      saw Charnock lying on a bundle of sacks. He was in a drunken stupor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Help Bill bring him, in," she said with stony calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson and the other lifted the unconscious man, and staggering along a
      passage, awkwardly climbed the stairs. They put him on his bed and were
      going out when Sadie stopped them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Bill; hold the team for a few minutes," she said and turned to
      Wilkinson. "I want you to wait in the office."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she shut the door, and after unfastening Charnock's collar and vest
      stood looking at him for a minute or two. He had not wakened, but she had
      seen him like this before and was not alarmed. His face was flushed and
      the veins on his forehead were prominent; his clothes were crumpled and
      sprinkled with bits of hay. Sadie studied him with a feeling of
      helplessness that changed to contemptuous pity. Her romantic dreams and
      ambitions had vanished and left her this&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she turned away her mood changed again. After all, he was her husband
      and she had schemed to marry him. She was honest with herself about this
      and admitted that Bob had not really loved her much. But he needed her and
      she must not fail him. There was some comfort in remembering that he had
      sought no other woman; her rivals were cards and liquor, and she did not
      mean that they should win. Obeying a sudden impulse, she turned back and
      kissed his hot face, and then, noting the smell of whisky, flushed and
      went out with a firm step.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she entered the office, however, her face was hard and white. She did
      not sit down, but leaned against a desk opposite Wilkinson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you ask Bob out to the range?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson did not like her look. It hinted that she was in a dangerous
      mood, but he answered good-humoredly: "I thought he wanted a change. You
      hold him too tight, Mrs. Charnock. Bob won't stand for being kept busy
      indoors all day; he won't make a clerk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He won't," said Sadie. "I'm beginning to see it now. But you don't care a
      straw for Bob. You wanted a pick on me because I made you cut out your
      game that night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Wilkinson, with a gesture of protest. "I certainly thought you
      were too smart, although it was not my business. Anyhow, if you let him
      have a quiet game with his friends at home&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pshaw! I know you, Jake Wilkinson, better than Bob does. You meant to
      make him drunk this evening and empty his wallet, and I guess you didn't
      find it hard."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson's face got red, but he saw he would gain nothing by denial.
      Besides, there was a matter he was anxious about.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It wasn't hard to empty his wallet, because he had only a few small
      bills."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I fixed that. How much did you win from him when he was drunk?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He got drunk afterwards," Wilkinson objected. "Then I didn't win it all;
      there were three or four others."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie smiled rather grimly. "How much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She got a jar when Wilkinson told her, but she fixed him with steady eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You knew what he had in his wallet, but let him go on? You thought
      Keller's would stand for the debt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Wilkinson, with some alarm; "we certainly thought so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. Keller's makes good. Take the pen and right out a bill like
      this&mdash;R. Charnock, debtor in losses on a card game."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know it's never done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's going to be done now, or you won't get your cheque. I know what I'm
      up against in you and your gang."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson hesitated, but he needed the money and made out the bill. After
      examining it, Sadie wrote a cheque.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've paid you once, for Keller's sake, but you had better stop the card
      games after this. Bob's not my partner in the business, and no more of my
      dollars will go on gambling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Wilkinson sharply, "you're smarter than I thought!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie gave him a searching glance and he noted an ominous tenseness in her
      pose and her drawn-back lips. He said afterwards that she looked like a
      wild cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyhow, I think I have you fixed. There's nothing doing in making Bob
      drunk again, but you had better understand what's going to happen if you
      try. The next time you drive over to the settlement after my husband I'll
      whip you in the street with a riding quirt."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson put the cheque in his pocket and picked up his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the whole, I guess I'd better not risk it," he said and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie let him go, and then went limply upstairs. She felt worn out and her
      brain was dull. She could not think, and a problem that demanded solving
      must wait until the morning. After looking into the room where Charnock
      lay and seeing that he was sleeping heavily, she went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning she shut herself in the office at the store and gave the
      clerks strict orders that she was not to be disturbed. Opening a drawer,
      she took out a rough balance sheet, which showed that the business was
      profitable and expanding fast. Things were going very well, in spite of
      Bob's extravagance, and she thought she had prevented his wasting any more
      money. In three or four years she could sell the hotel and store for a
      large sum and, as she thought of it, give herself a chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was young, clever, and attractive, and had recently tried to cultivate
      her mind. It was laborious work and she had not much time, but the
      clergyman of the little Episcopal church gave her some guidance and she
      made progress. For one thing, she was beginning to talk like Bob and
      thought he noticed this, although she had not told him about her studies.
      She meant to be ready to take her part in a wider and brighter life when
      she left the settlement. Knowing little about large towns, she exaggerated
      the pleasures they could offer. Montreal, for example, was a city of
      delight. She had been there twice and had seen the Ice Palace glitter
      against the frosty sky, the covered skating rinks, the jingling sleighs,
      and the toboggans rushing down the long, white slides. Then she remembered
      afternoon drives in summer on the wooded slopes of the Mountain, and
      evenings spent among the garish splendors of Dominion Park, where myriads
      of lights threw their colored reflections upon the river. Since then,
      however, her taste had got refined, and she now admitted that if she lived
      at Montreal it might be better to cut out Dominion Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she pulled herself up. It looked as if these delights were not for
      her. She could enjoy them, if she wanted, in a few years' time, but the
      risk was great. Bob might go to pieces while she earned the money that
      would open the gate of fairyland. Although she had checked the pace a
      little, he was going the wrong way fast. Sadie knitted her dark brows as
      she nerved herself to make a momentous choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the one hand there was everything she longed for; on the other much
      that she disliked&mdash;monotonous work, the loneliness of the frozen
      prairie in the bitter winter, the society, at very long intervals, of
      farmers who talked about nothing but their crops, and the unslackening
      strain of activity in the hot summer. Sadie thought of it with shrinking;
      she would soon get old and faded, and Bob, for whose sake she had done so,
      might turn from her. Yet there was danger for him if they stayed at the
      settlement. He had too many friends and whisky was always about. She must
      save him from the constant temptation and must do so now.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all that, she struggled. There were specious arguments for taking the
      other course. Bob had failed as a farmer and would certainly fail again if
      left to himself; but farming was the only occupation on the lonely
      prairie. Loneliness was essential, because he must be kept away from the
      settlements. But she saw the weak point in this reasoning, because Bob
      need not be left to himself. She would, so to speak, stand over him and
      see he did his work. Well, it looked as if she must let her ambitions go,
      and she got up, straightening her body with a little resolute jerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell the boss I want him," she said to the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock came in, looking haggard and somewhat ashamed, and Sadie knew she
      had made the right choice when he sat down where the light touched his
      face. For a moment he blinked and frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you'd pull down that blind," he said. "The sun's in my eyes, and I
      can't get round the desk."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie did so, and then silently gave him Wilkinson's bill. He gazed at the
      paper with surprise, and colored.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd no idea I lost so much. Why did you pay him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because you can't," said Sadie. "He thought you had a share in the
      business when he risked his dollars."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose that means you told him I wasn't your partner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," said Charnock, with some dryness. "You thought he'd leave me
      alone if he knew I wasn't worth powder and shot? Well, I believe it's very
      possible." Then he paused and smiled. "I can imagine his astonishment when
      you asked for a bill, and must admit that you're a sport. All the same,
      it's humiliating to have my friends told you don't trust me with money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The trouble is I can't trust you. Now you listen, Bob. This tanking and
      gambling has got to be stopped."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I've given you some bother," Charnock answered penitently.
      "For all that, I'm not so bad as I was. In fact, I really think I'm
      steadying down by degrees, and since you have paid my debts I don't mind
      promising&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By degrees won't do; you have got to stop right off. Besides, you know
      how much your promises are worth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock colored. "That's rather cruel, Sadie, but I suppose it's
      deserved."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mean what you think; not your promise to Miss Dalton," Sadie
      answered with some embarrassment. "You told me you wouldn't drive over to
      Wilkinson's again, and the first time I wasn't about you went. Very well.
      Since I can't trust you round the settlement, we're going to quit. I've
      decided to sell out the business as soon as I can get the price I want."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sell the store and hotel!" Charnock exclaimed. "I suppose you know you'd
      get three or four times as much if you held on for a few years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so. But what's going to happen to you while I wait?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock turned his head for a moment, and then looked up with a contrite
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By George, Sadie, you are fine! But I can't allow this sacrifice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't be asked," Sadie rejoined with forced quietness. She was moved
      by Charnock's exclamation, but durst not trust him or herself. There was a
      risk of his persuading her to abandon the plan if he knew how deeply she
      was stirred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said, "what do you propose to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take a farm far enough from town to make it hard for you to drive in and
      out. Donaldson's place would suit; he quits in the fall, you know, and we
      hold his mortgage."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock got up and walked about the floor. Then he stopped opposite his
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean well, Sadie, and you're very generous," he said with some
      emotion. "Still you ought to see the plan won't work. I had a good farm
      and made a horrible mess of things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't do that now. I'll be there," Sadie rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock did not answer, but gave her a curious look, and she pondered for
      a moment or two. He was obviously moved, but one could not tell how far
      his emotions went, and she knew he did not want to listen. She understood
      her husband and knew he sometimes deceived himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" He resumed; "it's too big a sacrifice! You like people about you and
      would see nobody but me and the hired man, while I admit I'm enough to jar
      a woman's nerves. Then think of the work; the manual work. You couldn't
      live as the bachelors live among dust and dirt, and it's a big undertaking
      to keep a homestead clean when you can't get proper help. Besides, there's
      the baking, cooking, and washing, while you have done nothing but
      superintend. I'd hate to see you worn and tired, and you know you're not
      so patient then. I get slack if things go wrong, and if I slouched about,
      brooding, when I ought to be at work, it would make you worse."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie smiled. "That's very nice, Bob; but how much are you thinking about
      me and how much about yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To tell the truth, I don't know," Charnock replied with nave honesty.
      "Anyhow, I am thinking about you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is what I like, but there's no use in talking. Since I can make this
      business go I can run a farm, and see no other way. My plan's made and I'm
      going to put it over."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock was silent for some moments and then turned to her with a look in
      his face she had not seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to farm, but if you can stand it for my sake, I must try.
      You will need some patience, Sadie&mdash;I may break out at times if the
      strain gets too hard. One can't help running away when one is something of
      a cur. But I'll come back, ashamed and sorry, and pitch in again. Since
      you mean to stand by me, perhaps I'll win out in the end."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bending down suddenly, he kissed her and then went to the door. She heard
      it shut, and sat still, but her eyes filled with tears. Bob had not
      promised much, but she thought he meant to keep his word now, and doubts
      that had troubled her melted away. She did not grudge the sacrifice she
      had made, for a ray of hope had begun to shine. It was, however,
      characteristic that after musing for a minute or two she took out some
      notepaper and began to write. Since the business must be sold, there was
      nothing to be gained by delay, and she gave a Winnipeg agent clear
      instructions. Then she went out and hid her annoyance when she saw
      Charnock sitting languidly on the hotel veranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has Wilkinson sent back our rig?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has, but the team has done enough. Where are you going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To look at Donaldson's farm. I want you to come along. Go across and ask
      Martin if he'll let you have his team."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock got up with a resigned shrug. "You are a hustler, Sadie. It's not
      many minutes since you decided about the thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see what I'd get by waiting, and you may as well make up your
      mind that you're going to hustle, too. Now get busy and go for Martin's
      team."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AN UNEXPECTED MEETING
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was a bright afternoon and white-edged clouds rolled across the sky
      before a fresh north-west wind when Helen Festing rode up to a birch bluff
      on the prairie. The trees made a musical rustling as they tossed their
      branches, tufted with opening leaves. The sweep of white grass was
      checkered by patches of green that gleamed when the light touched them and
      faded as the shadows swept across the plain. There was something strangely
      invigorating in the air, but when she reached the bluff Helen pulled up
      her horse and looked about.
    </p>
    <p>
      She missed the soft blue haze that mellowed the landscape among the
      English hills. Every feature was sharp and the colors were vivid; ocher,
      green, and silver gleaming with light. Distant bluffs stood out with sharp
      distinctness. She thought the new country was like its inhabitants; they
      were marked by a certain primitive vigor and their character was clearly
      defined. Neither the land nor the people had been tamed by cultivation
      yet. One missed the delicate half-tones on the prairie, but one heard and
      thrilled to the ringing note of endeavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she looked west the land was empty to the horizon, and a flock of big
      sand-hill cranes planed down the wind. An animal she thought was an
      antelope moved swiftly through the waves of rippling grass. When she
      turned east she saw a plume of black smoke roll across the sky and the
      tops of three elevators above the edge of the plain. It was a portent, a
      warning of momentous change, in which she and her husband must play their
      part. What that part would be she could not tell, but the curtain was
      going up, and on the whole she approved the stage and scenery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen had been some time in Canada and did not feel daunted. The sunshine
      and boisterous winds were bracing; one felt optimistic on the high plains,
      and the wide outlook gave a sense of freedom. She had many duties, but did
      not find them burdensome, or feel the strain of domestic labor she had
      been warned about. For one thing, her money had enabled Festing to arrange
      his household better than he had expected and hire useful help.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took a rough trail through the bluff, picking her way among the holes
      and rotting stumps, and as she rode out the horse plunged. After calming
      the startled animal she saw a dirty handkerchief snapping in the wind at
      the top of a stick. Close by a team cropped the grass and the end of a big
      plow projected from the back of a wagon. There seemed to be nobody about,
      but after riding on a few yards she saw a man lying among some bushes with
      a pipe in his mouth. He looked half asleep, but got up as she advanced,
      and she stopped her horse with a jerk and tried to preserve her calm.
      Charnock stood looking at her with a half-embarrassed smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bob!" she exclaimed. "I didn't think I'd ever meet you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope it wasn't a shock, and we were bound to meet sooner or later. The
      distance between our homesteads isn't great."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen had heard where his homestead was. Indeed, Festing had told her that
      if he had known Charnock was coming to Donaldson's farm, he would have
      located farther off. She would sooner have avoided the meeting, but since
      it had happened, she must not cut it too short.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what is the handkerchief for?" she asked. "And why were you lying
      there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a signal of distress. Another trail crosses the rise a mile off, and
      I was waiting in the hope that somebody might come along."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen now noted that a wheel of the wagon leaned to one side, and he
      remarked her glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The patent bush has got loose in the hub," he resumed. "I took the pin
      out and then saw I might have trouble if the wheel came off. It has been
      threatening to play this trick for some time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why didn't you put the bush right before you started?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. I expect you think it's typical."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen laughed. Bob was taking the proper line, and she studied him with
      curiosity. He looked older than she thought, but remembering Festing's
      hints, she did not see the mark of dissipation she had expected. Indeed,
      Charnock, having spent a sober month or two under Sadie's strict
      supervision, looked very well. His face was brown, his eyes twinkled, and
      his figure was athletic. He did not seem to need her pity, but she felt
      compassionate. After all, she had loved him and he had married a girl from
      a bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where were you taking the plow?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the smith's; one of the free preemptors has a forge some distance off,
      and if I'm lucky, I may find him at home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't find him at home if you stop here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's obvious," said Charnock. "Still, you see, the plow's too heavy for
      me to lift out. Unless I do get it out, I can't try to put the wheel
      right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why not take it to pieces?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The trouble is you need a bent spanner to get at some of the bolts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They give you spanners with the plows, and there's a box on the frame to
      put them in. I've seen Stephen use the things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so," Charnock agreed. "Stephen's methodical, but when I want my
      spanner it isn't in the box."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You never were very careful," Helen remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know if there's much comfort in feeling that I've paid for my
      neglect."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen smiled; she was not going to be sentimental. "If you mean that you
      lost the spanner, you don't seem to have suffered much. I think you were
      asleep when I rode up. But I was surprised to hear you had begun to farm
      again. Do you like it? And how are you getting on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like a number of things better, but that's not allowed to make much
      difference. Sadie has decided that farming is good for me. However, I am
      making some progress, though as you know my temperament, I'll admit that
      I'm being firmly helped along."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a few moments and Helen pondered. Bob had generally
      been tactful and she thought his humor was rather brave. He, no doubt,
      imagined she would soon learn all about his affairs and meant to make the
      best of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Charnock quietly studied her. She looked very fresh and
      prettier than he thought. Although she had not ridden much in England, he
      noted the grace and confidence with which she managed the spirited range
      horse. For all that, he was rather surprised by his sensations. He had
      expected to feel some embarrassment and sentimental tenderness when they
      met, but she left him cold; his pulse had not quickened a beat. Still it
      would be good for Sadie to know Helen, who could teach her much, and she
      unconsciously gave him a lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," she said, "I must get home. I shall, no doubt, see you now and
      then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not often, if you leave it to accident," he replied with a smile. "If you
      like to arrange the thing, there's a nice point of etiquette. You occupied
      your homestead before we came to ours, but you see we were on the prairie
      first. Anyhow, I'd be glad if you will let me bring Sadie over."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen thought he was going too far. She did not want to arrange for a
      meeting and would sooner not receive his wife. After all, the girl had
      supplanted her. Still she was curious and could not refuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm often busy and daresay Mrs. Charnock is, while Stephen does not stop
      work until late. However, if you like to take your chance&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Charnock; "we'll take the risk of finding you not at
      home. Now perhaps it wouldn't be much trouble if you told Jasper I'm in
      difficulties. You'll see his place when you cross the ravine near the
      bluff."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen rode away, but when she saw Jasper's farm it was a mile off the
      trail and she had to cross a broken sandy belt. For all that, she smiled
      as she made the round. It was typical of Bob to send her. He might have
      tethered his horses and walked the distance, but he had a talent for
      leaving to somebody else the things he ought to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper she sat on the veranda, while Festing leaned against the
      rails. The house was built of ship-lap boards, with a roof of cedar
      shingles, and wooden pillars supporting the projecting eaves. It had been
      improved and made comfortable with Helen's money, and with the land about
      it, registered as belonging to her. Festing had insisted on this, rather
      against her will, because she had meant to make it a gift to him. The
      wind, as usual at sunset, had dropped, and clear green sky, touched with
      dull red on the horizon, overhung the plain. The air was cold and bracing;
      sound carried far, and the musical chime of cowbells came from a distant
      bluff. There were not many cattle in the neighborhood, but the Government
      was trying to encourage stock-raising and had begun to build creameries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen meditatively studied her husband. Festing had been plowing since
      sunrise and looked tired. Something had gone wrong with his gasoline
      tractor, and she knew he had spent two or three hours finding out the
      fault. This had annoyed him, because time was valuable and he was
      impatient of delay. Helen approved his industry and the stubborn
      perseverance that led to his overcoming many obstacles, but sometimes
      thought he took things too hard and exaggerated their importance. Now as
      he leaned against the balustrade he had the physical grace of a
      well-trained athlete, but she thought his look was fretful and his mind
      too much occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I met Bob by the long bluff as I rode home," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing looked up sharply. "Well, I suppose you were bound to meet him
      before long. What was he doing at the bluff?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Waiting for somebody to help him with his wagon," Helen answered with a
      laugh. "A wheel was coming off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was like Bob. He has a rooted objection to helping himself when it
      means an effort."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For all that, you were a friend of his."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not his friend now. I've done with the fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's rather awkward," Helen remarked thoughtfully. "He asked if he might
      bring his wife over, and although I wasn't very gracious, I could not
      refuse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well, it doesn't matter. As I won't have a minute until the sowing is
      finished, I'll be out when he comes. If he stayed with his work just now,
      it would be better for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen was silent for a moment. Stephen was made of much finer stuff than
      Bob, but he had not the latter's graceful humor and his curtness jarred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's no reason you should resume your friendship if you don't like,"
      she said. "All the same, I think you ought to be polite to my guests."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't pretend. The house is yours, but I don't want the fellow here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why do you dislike him so much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think you need ask me that. It's dangerous ground, but you see&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have forgiven him," Helen answered, smiling. "Indeed, if I hadn't done
      so long since, it would be easy to forgive him now. At first, I did feel
      dreadfully humiliated, but I soon saw what he had saved me from. And, of
      course, if he had kept his promise, I could not have married you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing looked at her with surprise. In spite of her refinement, Helen
      would now and then talk calmly about matters he shrank from mentioning.
      But after the lead she had given him he could be frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said, "I haven't forgiven him yet; I couldn't pretend
      friendship with anybody who had slighted you. Besides, when I found out
      how he had cheated me it was the worst moment of my life. I thought you
      would never speak to me again because, through the fellow's treachery, it
      was I who hurt you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're very nice, Stephen," Helen replied, coloring. "But that's all
      finished. Don't you like Bob's wife? I really don't want to meet her, but
      one mustn't be a coward."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You couldn't be a coward. Sadie has her virtues and is certainly much too
      good for Bob, but I don't want her here for all that. Frankly, she's not
      your sort, and she's meddlesome. I'm not afraid she'll make you
      discontented, but I can't have a girl like that telling you how your house
      ought to be run. Although you're a beginner, you manage very well, and I'd
      object to improvements on somebody else's plan."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen smiled. "When you talk like that, you're charming; but we'll say no
      more about it. You look tired. Are you sure you are not working too hard?
      The last time Jasper came he seemed surprised when he saw the ground you
      had broken. I imagined he thought you were trying to do too much."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke she glanced at the wide belt of plowing that broke the
      delicate green and silver of the grass. In the foreground, the rows of
      clods shone with an oily gleam in the fading light. Farther off, the rows
      converged and melted into a sweep of purple-brown that narrowed as it
      crossed a distant rise. There were two other belts; one where white
      grasses broke through the harrow-torn sod, and another flat and smooth
      where the land-packer had rolled in the seed. All told of strenuous effort
      in which sweating men and horses had been aided by tractor machines.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jasper's conservative and I feel I ought to do as much as I can," Festing
      replied. "When you bought the place you rather put me on my mettle."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen gave him a sharp glance. "I note that you spoke of it as my house
      when you ought to have said ours. I don't like that, Stephen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is yours. I let you buy it because it's value must go up and the
      money's safe. I'm glad, of course, that you have comforts I couldn't have
      given you, but it's my business to support my wife, and I've got to
      increase my capital. I want to give you things you like, bought with money
      I have earned."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You really want to feel independent of me," Helen suggested with a smile.
      "I suppose it's an honest ambition, but isn't the distinction you try to
      make ridiculous?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps, in a way," Festing agreed. "All the same, your help makes it my
      duty to do my best. I don't want to feel I might be forced to fall back on
      your dollars."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are ridiculous, Stephen," Helen rejoined. "However, let's talk about
      something else."
    </p>
    <p>
      The talked good-humoredly until the dew and growing cold drove them in.
      Next morning Helen got up while the sun rose from behind a bluff on the
      edge of the plain, but when she went out on the veranda she saw the
      gasoline tractor and gang-plow lurch across the rise. This indicated that
      Festing had been at work for some time, and she looked thoughtful as she
      went back into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen was doing too much, and she wondered whether he could keep it up.
      Things, however, might be easier when the crop was sown, and if not she
      must insist upon his hiring extra help. She liked to see him keen about
      his work, but for the last few weeks he had scarcely had a minute to talk
      to her, and she could not allow him to wear himself out. After all, her
      money gave her some power, and there was no reason she should not use the
      power for her husband's benefit.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      SADIE FINDS A FRIEND
    </h3>
    <p>
      The sun shone hot on the rippling grass, but it was cool on the shady
      veranda where Helen sat in a basket chair. A newspaper lay close by and
      the loose leaves fluttered now and then, but she did not notice that it
      was in some danger of blowing away. She had been occupied since early
      morning, but was not quite asleep, for she was vaguely conscious of a
      rhythmic drumming. By and by she raised her head with a jerk and glanced
      at the watch on her wrist. It was three o'clock and she had been dozing
      for an hour. Then the drumming fixed her attention and she saw a rig lurch
      along the uneven trail. The horses were trotting fast and there were two
      people in the light wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen saw that one was Charnock. The other, who held the reins, was, no
      doubt, his wife, and Helen was sorry that Festing was at work beyond the
      rise. She would have liked him to be there when she received her visitors,
      but did not think it prudent to send for him. The rig was near the house
      now, and as she got up her dress moved the newspaper, which was caught by
      a draught and blew down the stairs and across the grass. It flapped in the
      fresh wind and fell near the horses' feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was too much for the range-bred animals to stand, and they reared and
      plunged, and then began to back away from the fluttering white object.
      Charnock jumped out and ran towards their heads, but Sadie raised her whip
      with a gesture of command.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't butt in, Bob; I'm going to take them past."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock stood back obediently, though his alert pose hinted that he was
      ready to run forward if he were needed, and Helen studied his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie, dressed in black and white, with a black feather in her white hat,
      was braced back on the driving seat, with one hand on the reins while she
      used the whip. There was a patch of bright color in her face, her eyes
      flashed, and the rigidity of her figure gave her an air of savage
      resolution. She looked a handsome virago as she battled with the powerful
      horses, which plunged and kicked while the wagon rocked among the ruts.
      Helen watched the struggle with somewhat mixed feelings. This was the girl
      for whom Bob had given her up!
    </p>
    <p>
      After an exciting minute or two Sadie forced the horses to pass the
      fluttering paper, and then pulled them up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's Stephen?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen said he was harrowing on the other side of the rise, and Sadie,
      getting down, signed to Charnock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put the team in the stable, and then go and look for Festing. Don't come
      back too soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she came towards the house and Helen felt half-annoyed and
      half-amused. Stephen did not like to be disturbed when he was busy, and
      she knew what he thought of Bob. Moreover, she wondered with some
      curiosity what Mrs. Charnock had to say to her. Sadie sat down and waited
      until she recovered breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know who I am," she remarked presently. "Bob can drive all right, but
      he's too easy with the team. I don't see why I should get down before I
      want because the horses are scared by a paper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps it was better to make them go on, but they nearly upset you,"
      Helen agreed with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie gave her a steady, criticizing glance, but her nave curiosity
      softened her rudeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I wanted to see you. Looks as if Bob was a fool, in one way, but I
      guess I can see him through what he's up against on the prairie better
      than you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen had been prejudiced against Mrs. Charnock, but her blunt sincerity
      was disarming. Besides, she had expected something different; a hint of
      defiance, or suspicious antagonism.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's very possible," she said. "Everything is strange here. I feel rather
      lost sometimes and have much to learn."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie studied her closely, and after pondering for a few moments resumed:
      "When I was driving over I didn't know how I was going to take you; in
      fact, I've been bothering about it for some time. I thought you might be
      dangerous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You thought I might be dangerous!" Helen exclaimed with rising color.
      "Surely you understand&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now you wait a bit and let me finish! Well, I might have come now and
      then, found out what I could, and given you a hint or two, until we saw
      how things were going to be. But that's not my way, and I reckon it's not
      yours. Very well. We have got to have a talk and put the thing over. To
      begin with, I somehow feel I can trust you, and needn't be disturbed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'm afraid you are rash," Helen rejoined with a resentment that was
      softened by a touch of humor. "You can't form a reliable opinion, because
      you don't know me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so, but I know Bob."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen laughed. She ought to be angry, for Mrs. Charnock was taking an
      extraordinary line. But perhaps it was the best line, because it would
      clear the ground. She said nothing and Sadie went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you like it here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very much. I like the open country and the fresh air. Then I think I like
      the people, and one has so much to do that there is not time to feel
      moody. It's bracing to find every minute occupied by something useful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you feel that way about it, you'll make good. And you've got a fine
      man for your husband. When Festing first came to the bridge I didn't know
      if I'd take him or Bob. In fact, I thought about it for quite a time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen's eyes sparkled. Mrs. Charnock was going too far, but she controlled
      her resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all, were you not taking something for granted?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Sadie thoughtfully, "if I'd tried hard, I might have got
      Steve then, but I don't know if I'd have been any happier with him. He'd
      have gone his own way and taken me along; a good way, perhaps, but it
      wouldn't have been mine. Bob's different; sometimes he has to be hustled
      and sometimes led, but you get fond of a man you must take care of. Then
      everybody likes Bob, and he kind of grows on you. I don't know how it is,
      but you can't get mad with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen thought there was something humiliating to Bob in his wife's
      patience, but she was moved. Mrs. Charnock loved her husband, though she
      knew his faults. Then Sadie resumed in a harder voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyhow, he's mine and I know how to keep what belongs to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I imagine you will keep him. I have no wish to take him away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's why I came. I wanted to see you, and now I'm satisfied. Bob
      needs a friend like your husband and he puts Steve pretty high. If you can
      see your way to let us drive over now and then evenings&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen pondered this. Stephen might object, but he was not unreasonable,
      and his society would certainly be good for Bob. She was not altogether
      pleased by the thought of the Charnocks' visits, but Sadie's resolve to
      help her husband had touched her. Then there was something flattering in
      the hint that she and Stephen could take a part in his reformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," she said. "I hope you will come when you like. It will do
      Stephen no harm to get a rest instead of hurrying back to work after
      supper."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie looked grateful. "We'll certainly come. I've talked to you as I'd
      have talked to nobody else, but you know Bob most as well as I do. But
      perhaps there's enough said. Won't you show me the house?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen realized that she had made an alliance with Mrs. Charnock for Bob's
      protection, and was conscious of a virtuous thrill. The work she had
      undertaken was good, but she remembered with faint uneasiness that she had
      pledged her husband to it without his consent. She showed Sadie the house,
      and while there was much the latter admired, she made, from her larger
      knowledge of the plains, a number of suggestions that Helen thought
      useful. By and by Bob returned with Festing for supper, and stopped for
      another hour. When he and Sadie had gone Festing frowned as he glanced at
      his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's too late to finish the job I wanted to do tonight," he said, and
      indicated the dark figures of a man and horses silhouetted against the
      sunset on the crest of the rise. "There's Jules coming home. He couldn't
      get on without me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen pretended not to notice his annoyance. "After all, you're not often
      disturbed, and a little relaxation is good. I've no doubt you had an
      amusing talk with Bob."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bob bored me badly, though we didn't talk much. I was driving the
      disc-harrows and he lay in the grass. I had to stop for a few minutes
      every time I reached the turning and listen to his remarks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you feel you deserve some sympathy?" Helen said with a laugh. "Well,
      I suppose it was an infliction to be forced to talk."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing's annoyance vanished. "I mustn't make too much of it. I really
      don't object to talking when I've finished my work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When do you finish your work, Stephen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a fair shot! In summer, I stop when it's too dark to see. The
      annoying thing wasn't so much the stopping as Bob's attitude. He lay there
      with his pipe, looking as if nothing would persuade him to work, and his
      smile hinted that he thought delaying me an excellent joke. I believe I
      was polite, but certainly hope he won't come back."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen thought it was not the proper time to tell him about the invitation
      she had given Sadie, and she said, "Idleness seems to jar you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does. I dislike the man who demands the best to eat and drink and
      won't use his brain or muscle if he can help. In this country, the thing's
      immoral; the fellow's obviously a cheat. We live by our labor, raising
      grain and cattle&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what about the people in the towns?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A number of them handle our products and supply us with tools. Of course,
      there are speculators and real-estate boomsters who gamble with our
      earnings, but their job is not as easy as it looks. They run big risks and
      bear some strain. Still, if it was left to me, I'd make them plow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen laughed. "You're rather drastic, Stephen; but if one takes the long
      view, I dare say you are right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then let's take the narrowest view we can. When a farmer who hasn't much
      money loafs about the poolroom and lies on his back, smoking, it's plain
      that he's taking advantage of somebody else. Perhaps the thing's shabbiest
      when he puts his responsibilities on his wife. That's what Bob does."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid he does," Helen admitted, and mused, while Festing lighted his
      pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen was not a prig and she recognized the justice of his arguments,
      but he was rather hard and his views were too clear-cut. He saw that a
      thing was good or bad, but could not see that faults and virtues sometimes
      merged and there was good in one and bad in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," she said, "I like Mrs. Charnock, and she is certainly energetic
      and practical. She went over the house and suggested some improvements.
      For example, you are building a windmill pump for the cattle, and it
      wouldn't cost very much to bring a pipe to the house. A tap is a great
      convenience and would save Jules' time filling up the tank."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will need a long pipe and cost more than Sadie thinks, but I'll have
      it done. However, I wish I had thought of it and she hadn't made the
      suggestion. I don't want Sadie interfering with our house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you don't dislike Mrs. Charnock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in a way; but I don't know that I want to see her here. Sadie has a
      number of good points, but she's rather fond of managing other folks'
      affairs. Then she's not your kind."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, Helen was not displeased. Mrs. Charnock's bold statements
      that she could have got Stephen if she had wanted had jarred, but it
      looked as if she had made an empty boast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you were a democrat," she remarked, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I am, in general; but when it's a matter of choosing my wife's
      friends, I'm an exclusive aristocrat. That's the worst of having theories;
      they don't apply all round."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen thought his utilitarian dislike of idleness was open to this
      objection, but it was not the time to urge Bob's cause. She would wait for
      another opportunity, when Stephen had not been delayed, and she made him a
      humorous curtsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes you're rather bearish, and sometimes you're very nice," she
      said, and went into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Charnocks returned a week later and came again at regular intervals,
      while Helen rode over to their house now and then. Festing refused to
      accompany her and sometimes grumbled, but on the whole tolerated
      Charnock's visits so long as they did not delay his work. Nothing must be
      allowed to interfere with that, for he was uneasily conscious that he had
      set himself too big a task. His dislike to using his wife's money had
      spurred him on, and he had sown a very large crop at a heavy expense for
      labor, horses, and machines. Now he must spare no effort to get his money
      back, and much depended on the weather. Indeed, he was beginning to feel
      the strain of the unrelaxing exertion and care about details, and this
      sometimes reacted upon his temper. Still he must hold out until the crop
      was reaped, after which he could go easy during the winter months.
    </p>
    <p>
      One hot afternoon, he lay under a mower in a sloo where the melted snow
      had run in spring and the wild grass now grew tall. It made good hay and
      the fierce sun had dried it well, so that he had only to cut and haul it
      home; but something had gone wrong with the machine, and after taking out
      the broken knife he dismantled the driving gear. When he crawled out, with
      a greasy cogwheel in his hand, he was soaked with perspiration and his
      overalls were stained by oil. The mosquitoes, that did not as a rule
      venture out in the strong wind and sun, had bitten him badly while he lay
      in the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better wait for ten minutes and take a smoke," said Charnock, who
      had come up quietly and sat in the shade of the partly-loaded wagon.
      "You'll get on faster when you have cooled down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You believe in waiting, don't you?" Festing rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock laughed. "I feel justified in going slow just now. Sadie has
      given me a day off, and when she doesn't think I ought to work it
      certainly isn't necessary. It saves you some bother if you can leave that
      sort of thing to your wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pshaw!" said Festing. "You make me tired."
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked up the broken knife and looked at Charnock. Bob was bantering
      him, exaggerating his slackness. As a matter of fact, the fellow was not
      so lazy as he pretended; Sadie was beginning to wake him up. Stephen did
      not know if he had forgiven him or not, but they had gradually dropped
      back into something like their old relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might take off the broken blades," he resumed. "You'll find new ones
      in the box. They ought to be riveted, but if you use the short bolts and
      file down the nuts, I dare say they'll run through the guides."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he crawled back under the machine and did not come out until he head
      a rattle of wheels. Wilkinson, whom he knew and disliked, stopped his team
      close by and began to talk to Charnock. This annoyed Festing, because he
      was nearly ready to replace the knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I called at your place and found you were out," Wilkinson remarked. "They
      told me where you had gone, and when I saw Festing's wagon I reckoned you
      might have gone with him. You come here pretty often, don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Steve's patient," Charnock replied with a twinkle. "I'm not sure he
      enjoys my visits, but he puts up with them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I want you to drive over to-morrow evening. A man you know from
      Winnipeg is coming to see me about a deal in Brandon building lots. The
      thing looks good and ought to turn out a snap."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The trouble is I haven't much money to invest," Charnock answered, and
      Festing thought he was hesitating. It looked as if Wilkinson had not seen
      him yet, for he was standing behind the machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand you have a bigger interest in the farm than you had in the
      hotel and something might be arranged. Anyhow, come over and hear what our
      friend has to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll be a fool if you go, Bob," Festing interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know that this is your business," Wilkinson rejoined. "I haven't
      suggested that you should join us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know I wouldn't join you. I had one deal with you, and that's enough.
      No doubt you remember selling me the brown horse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You tried the horse before you bought him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did. He was quiet then, but I've since suspected that he was doped.
      Anyhow, he nearly killed my hired man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson laughed. "You had your trial and backed your judgment. Know more
      about machines than horses, don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't know the man I dealt with then. You warranted the brute
      good-tempered and easy to drive. I'll give you five dollars if you'll take
      him out of the stable and harness him now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't time," said Wilkinson. "Didn't charge you high and guess you've
      got to pay for learning your business. The trouble is you're too sure
      about yourself and reckoned you'd make a splash at farming without much
      trouble. Anyhow, I don't want to sell Charnock a horse; he's a better
      judge than you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's not much judge of building lots. If your friend has got a safe snap,
      why do you want to let Charnock in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson began to look impatient. "I came over to talk to Charnock, and
      if he likes the deal it's not your affair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is my affair if you stop him when he's helping me," Festing rejoined.
      "If he's a fool, he'll talk to you some other time; if he's wise, he
      won't. Just now I'd sooner you drove off my farm."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson gave him a curious look. "Very well. I reckon the place is
      yours; or your wife's." Then he turned to Charnock. "Are you coming over,
      Bob?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Charnock, irresolutely, "I don't think I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      He lighted his pipe when Wilkinson started his team, and presently
      remarked: "On the whole, I'm glad you headed him off, because I might have
      gone. You mean well, Stephen, but that man doesn't like you, and I've
      sometimes thought he doesn't like Sadie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It doesn't matter if he likes me or not," said Festing. "Let's get on
      with the mower."

      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE CHEQUE
    </h3>
    <p>
      The North-west breeze was fresher than usual when, one afternoon, Helen
      rode through a belt of sand-hills on her way to the Charnock farm. Clouds
      of dust blew about the horse's feet, and now and then fine grit whistled
      past her head. She had her back to the boisterous wind, but she urged the
      horse until they got behind a grove of scrub poplars. Then she rolled up
      her veil and wiped her face before she looked about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Round, dark clouds rolled across the sky, as they had done since spring,
      but for nearly a month none had broken. A low ridge, streaked by flying
      shadows, ran across the foreground, and waves of dust rose and fell about
      its crest. Sandy belts are common on parts of the prairie, and when they
      fringe cultivated land are something of a danger in a dry season, because
      the loose sand travels far before the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the sand-hills, the level grass was getting white and dry, and in
      the distance the figures of a man and horses stood out against a moving
      cloud of dust. Helen supposed he was summer-fallowing, but did not
      understand the dust, because when she last passed the spot the soil looked
      dark and firm. She remembered that Festing had been anxious about the
      weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riding on, she saw the roof of the Charnock homestead above a straggling
      bluff, and her thoughts centered on its occupants. Strange as the thing
      was, she had come to think of Sadie as her friend. Her loyalty and her
      patience with her husband commanded respect, and now it looked as if they
      would be rewarded. Bob was taking an interest in his farm and had worked
      with steady industry for the last month or two. Helen thought she deserved
      some credit for this; she had had a part in Bob's reformation and had made
      Stephen help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie trusted her, and no suspicion or jealousy marked their relations.
      Indeed, Helen wondered why she had at one time been drawn to Bob. Were she
      free to do so, she would certainly not marry him now. Still she had loved
      him, and this gave her thoughts about him a vague, sentimental gentleness.
      It was a comfort to feel that she had done something to turn his wandering
      feet into the right path.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she reached the homestead she found Sadie looking disturbed. Her face
      was hard, but her eyes were red, and Helen suspected that she had been
      crying. It was obvious that something serious had happened, because
      Sadie's pluck seldom broke down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad you came," the latter said. "I'm surely in trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen asked what the trouble was, and Sadie told her in jerky sentences.
      Charnock had started for the railroad early that morning, and after he
      left she discovered that he had written a cheque, payable to Wilkinson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not so much the money, but to feel he has cheated me and broken
      loose when I thought he was cured," she concluded. "He has been going
      steady, but now that brute has got hold of him he'll hang around the
      settlement, tanking and betting, for a week or two. Then he'll be slack
      and moody and leave the farm alone, and I'll have to begin the job again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie paused, with tears in her eyes, and then pulled herself together.
      "Pshaw!" she said, "I'm a silly fool. Before you came I thought I'd quit
      and let Bob go his own way; but I'm not beaten yet. If Wilkinson wants
      him, there's going to be some fight. Now, I want you to ride over with me
      to the fellow's place."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen felt sympathetic. Sadie's resentment was justified, and she looked
      rather refined when angry. Her stiff pose lent her a touch of dignity; her
      heightened color and the sparkle in her eyes gave her face the charm of
      animation. Moreover, her want of reserve no longer jarred. Reserve is not
      very common on the plains.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you must tell me something about it first," Helen replied. "How did
      you find out he had written the cheque?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suspected something after he'd gone and looked for his cheque-book.
      He'd torn out a form, but hadn't filled up the tab. Bob's silly when he's
      cunning and didn't think about his blotter. The top sheet was nearly clean
      and I read what he'd written, in a looking-glass."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did he give Wilkinson the money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess it's to speculate in wheat or building-lots, and Bob will
      certainly lose it all; but that's not what makes me mad. After all, it's
      his money; he's been saving it since he steadied down. I can manage Bob if
      he's left alone, and thought I'd cut out the friends he shouldn't have.
      Wilkinson was the only danger left, but he's a blamed tough proposition."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen knew Festing disliked the man, but she felt puzzled. "The sum is not
      very large," she said. "I don't quite see why Wilkinson thought it worth
      while&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It shows he's pinched for money, and there's some hope in that. Then he
      doesn't like me, and I imagine he has a pick on your husband. Stephen
      froze him off one day when he was getting after Bob. Anyhow, I mean to get
      the money back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But can you? It is Bob's cheque."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to try. The bank deals with <i>me</i>," Sadie answered. "But
      come along; I hear the hired man bringing the rig."
    </p>
    <p>
      When they got into the vehicle, Helen remarked that Sadie had brought a
      flexible riding whip. Since the quirt was useless for driving, Helen
      wondered what she meant to do with it. The trail they took ran through the
      grass, a sinuous riband of hard-beaten soil that flashed where it caught
      the light. It was seamed by ruts and fringed by wild barley but in places
      the grass had spread across it, leaving gaps, into which the horses' legs
      and the wheel sank. The smell of wild peppermint rose from among the
      crackling stalks as the team brushed through. Now and then a prairie-hen
      got up, and small animals, like English squirrels, squatted by the trail
      until the wheels were nearly upon them, and then dived into holes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The gophers are surely plentiful," Sadie remarked. "Don't know that I've
      seen so many around before, and that's going to be bad for the grain.
      They're generally worst when the crop is poor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think the crop will be poor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie glanced at the sky, which was a dazzling blue, flooded with light,
      except where the scattered clouds drove by.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We didn't get the June rains, and the frost-damp has gone down pretty
      deep. Then we have had very few thunder-storms, and the sand is blowing
      bad. It makes trouble in parts of Manitoba, but the scrub trees in our
      sand-hills generally hold it up. What does Steve think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He hasn't told me. Sometimes he looks anxious, but he doesn't talk about
      it much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's Steve's way. I don't know if it's a good way. He sees when he's up
      against a hard thing and makes his own plans. Now I want to know my
      husband's troubles. You feel better when you can talk."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen agreed with Sadie; she often wished Stephen would talk to her about
      his anxieties. He wanted to save her and had confidence in himself, but
      she felt that he left her out too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How does the sand damage the wheat?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cuts the stalk. Takes time, of course, but the sharp grit puts down the
      grain like a binder knife, if it blows through the field long enough.
      However, I'm not worrying much about that; there are worse things than the
      sand and drought. We're fools and make our real troubles; that's what's
      the matter with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen smiled. Sadie was amusing when philosophized, but Helen thought her
      views were sound. She had chosen a stern country, but its stinging cold
      and boisterous winds were invigorating, and with pluck one could overcome
      its material obstacles. It was human weaknesses that made for unhappiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," she said, "we must hope the rain will come; but hadn't we better
      go by the long bluff? The new man has put a fence across the other trail."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie left the trail, and as they crossed a hollow the tall grass rustled
      about the horses' legs. It had lost its verdure; the red lilies and banks
      of yellow flowers had withered on their parched stalks. When they reached
      the level the grass was only a few inches high and the wide plain rolled
      back in the strong light, shining pale-yellow and gray. It was only when
      the shadows passed that one could see streaks and patches of faded green.
      In the distance a cluster of roofs broke the bare expanse, and Helen knew
      they marked the Wilkinson ranch. A horse and buggy approached it, looking
      very small, and she glanced at Sadie, who said nothing, although her face
      was stern. By and by the latter stopped her team in front of the homestead
      and fastened the reins to a post.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," she said, "you sit on the veranda and wait for me. It was
      Wilkinson's rig we saw, and I'll find him in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson looked up from the table at which he was writing when Sadie
      entered the room. He was, on the whole, a handsome man, but was rather
      fat, and his black eyes were unusually close together. This perhaps
      accounted for the obliquity of his glance, which, some believed, conveyed
      a useful hint about his character. He was neatly dressed in light, summer
      clothes, although the farmers generally wore brown overalls. As he got up
      his look indicated that he was trying to hide his annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is something of a surprise, Mrs. Charnock," he said politely.
      "However, if there's anything I can do&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can sit down again in the meantime," Sadie replied, and occupied a
      chair opposite, with the quirt on her knee. "To begin with, if you're
      writing to your Winnipeg friend, you had better wait a bit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not writing to Winnipeg; but don't see what this has to do with your
      visit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you haven't sent off Bob's cheque yet! I mean to get it back."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson saw that he had made a rash admission. Mrs. Charnock was
      cleverer than he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If Bob wants it back, why didn't he come himself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He doesn't know I have come," Sadie answered calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson studied her and did not like her look. Her face was hard, her
      color higher than usual, and her eyes sparkled ominously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said, "you told me you would pay no more of your husband's
      debts, but this is not a debt. Besides, the money must be Bob's, since he
      gave me the cheque."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did he give it you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was awkward, because Wilkinson did not want to state that he
      had persuaded Bob to join him in a speculation. This was the best
      construction that could be put upon the matter, and he did not think it
      would satisfy Mrs. Charnock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why does a man give another a cheque?" he rejoined, with a look of
      good-humor that he did not feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The best reason I know of is&mdash;for value received. But this doesn't
      apply. You allowed it wasn't a debt, so Bob has got no value."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One sometimes pays for value one expects to get."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie laughed scornfully. "If that's what Bob has done, he'll get badly
      stung. There's nothing coming to him from a deal with you. I guess you
      don't claim he made you a present of the money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't," said Wilkinson, with a frown, for he thought he saw where she
      was leading him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. One pays for something one has got or is going to get, and as
      we can rule out both reasons, the cheque is bad. In fact, it's not worth
      keeping. Better give it me back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your argument looks all right, Mrs. Charnock, but you don't start from
      sure ground. How do you know there's nothing coming to your husband?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know you," Sadie rejoined. "Anyhow, the cheque is certainly bad.
      They'll turn it down if you take it to the bank."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson made an abrupt movement. "You can't stop your husband's cheque.
      You don't mean he hasn't the dollars to meet it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't," said Sadie, with an angry flush. "Bob is honest. The money's
      there, but if you think the bank will pay when I tell them not, go and
      see. The manager knows me and he knows you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson saw that he was beaten, but tried to hide his anger. "Well, it
      looks as if Bob was lucky. He has a wife who will take care of him, and I
      reckon he needs something of the kind. However, here's the cheque; I want
      a receipt."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie wrote the receipt and he noted that her hand shook. As she got up he
      glanced at the quirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you ride over? I thought I heard a rig."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I drove," said Sadie. "Looks as I needn't have brought the quirt. Well,
      I'm glad you agreed about the cheque being bad. I meant to get it anyhow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson gave her a curious look, but said nothing and she went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've saved Bob's money," she told Helen as she started the team.
      "Wilkinson saw my arguments and didn't kick as much as I expected, but he
      certainly doesn't like me any better. I think he'll make trouble if he
      can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That seems unlikely," Helen remarked. "I imagine that as you have beaten
      him he'll be glad to let the matter drop. No doubt he wanted the money and
      was vexed because he had to give it up, but I hardly think he'll try to
      revenge himself on you. Men don't do these things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My husband and yours don't, but Wilkinson is different," Sadie answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock had not returned when she reached the farm, and after Helen left
      she sat on the veranda, feeling disturbed. Bob had told her he was going
      to the railroad to bring out some goods, but he could have got back two or
      three hours earlier. Then Wilkinson no doubt knew where he had gone. A
      small settlement, with two new hotels, had sprung up round the station,
      and as the place was easily reached by the construction gangs there was
      now and then some drunkenness and gambling. For all that, Sadie did not
      mean to anticipate trouble, and set about some household work that her
      drive had delayed. It got dark before she finished, but Bob did not come,
      and she went outside again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was clear and refreshingly cold after the scorching day. The
      wind had dropped, everything was very quiet, and she could see for some
      distance across the plain. The hollows were picked out by belts of darker
      shadow, and the scattered bluffs made dim gray blurs, but nothing moved on
      the waste, and she did not hear the beat of hoofs she listened for.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time she sat still, lost in gloomy thought. Bob's relapse had been a
      bitter disappointment, because she had begun to hope that the danger of
      his resuming his former habits was past. He had stuck to his work, which
      seemed to absorb his interest, and had looked content. There was ground
      for believing that with a little judicious encouragement he might make a
      good farmer, and Sadie did not grudge the patient effort necessary to keep
      him in the proper path. Now he had left it again and might wander far
      before she could lead him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all that, she did not mean to give up. She had fought hard for Bob and
      was resolved to win, while there was a ray of comfort. The woman she had
      at first thought a danger was her best friend, and she felt for Helen
      Festing a grateful admiration that sometimes moved her deeply. Helen had
      many advantages that she could not have combated had they been used
      against her: grace, polish, and a knowledge of the world in which Bob had
      lived. But Helen was on her side. Sadie's admiration was perhaps
      warranted, but she undervalued her own patience and courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length she got drowsy and forgot her troubles. She did not think she
      really went to sleep, but after a time she got up with a start. A beat of
      hoofs and rattle of wheels had roused her, and she saw a rig coming
      towards the house. For a minute or two she stood shivering and trying to
      brace herself. If Bob was driving, things might be better than she
      thought; but when the horses stopped another man got down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you'd better rouse out your hired man, Mrs. Charnock," he said
      awkwardly. "I've got your husband here, but it's going to take two of us
      to bring him in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie brought a lamp and, with her mouth firmly set, looked into the rig.
      Bob lay upon some sacks in an ungainly attitude, and the jolting had not
      broken his heavy sleep. It was some time since he had come home like this,
      and Sadie felt dejected and tired. Then with an effort she went to waken
      the hired man.
    </p>
    <p>
      They carried Charnock in, and when she had given the driver some money she
      sat down and indulged her passionate indignation. Wilkinson had sent the
      rig, but had not been prompted by kindness when he told the man to drive
      Bob back; it was his revenge for his defeat. He had found Bob, made him
      drunk, when there was nothing to be gained by doing so, and sent him home
      like this. The fellow was poison-mean, but she thought him rash. He had
      struck her a cruel blow, but she did not mean to sit still and nurse the
      wound. She must strike back with all the force she could use and make him
      sorry he had provoked her to fight. Then, putting off her half-formed
      plans until next day, she went to bed.

      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A COUNTER-STROKE
    </h3>
    <p>
      When Sadie got up next morning she ordered the buggy to be brought round,
      and then went to look at Charnock. He was asleep, of which she was rather
      glad, because there was something to be said and she was highly strung.
      She could not trust her temper yet and might go too far. Bob was generally
      docile, particularly when repentant; but it was possible to drive him into
      an obstinate mood when nothing could be done with him. She was angry, but
      her anger was mainly directed against Wilkinson.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast she drove off across the plain. It was about eight
      o'clock, but the sun was hot. The breeze was not so fresh as usual, and a
      bank of dark clouds rolled up above the prairie's edge. They looked solid
      and their rounded masses shone an oily black, and she wondered whether
      they promised one of the thunder-storms that often broke upon the plains
      on summer afternoons. She would have welcomed the savage downpour, even if
      it had spoiled her clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie was getting anxious about the crop. Its failure would mean a serious
      loss, and she hated to see labor and money wasted; but this was not all.
      Knowing the risks the farmer ran on newly-broken land, she had not
      adventured too much of her capital on the first year's harvest; but
      success might encourage Bob, while failure would certainly daunt him. He
      would work for an object he was likely to gain, but if disappointed,
      regretted the exertions he had made, and refused, with humorous logic, to
      be stirred to fresh effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not convinced that farming's my particular duty," he once said. "When
      I plow it's in the expectation of cashing the elevator warrants for the
      grain. If I'm not to reap the crop, it seems to me that working fourteen
      hours a day is a waste of time that might be agreeably employed in
      shooting or riding about."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie urged that one got nothing worth having without a struggle. Bob
      rejoined: "If you get the thing you aim at, the struggle's justified; if
      you don't you think of what you've missed while you were uselessly
      employed. Of course, if you like a struggle, you have the satisfaction of
      following your bent; but hustling is a habit that has no charm for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie reflected that the last remark was true. Bob never hustled; his talk
      and movements were marked by a languid grace that sometimes pleased and
      sometimes irritated her. It was difficult to make him angry, and she was
      often silenced by his whimsical arguments when she knew she was right. But
      he was her husband, and she meant to baulk the man who hoped to profit by
      his carelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she urged the horse. It was a long drive to the settlement where she
      had kept the hotel, and she had not been there for some time. The goods
      she and her neighbors bought came from the new settlement on the railroad,
      which was not far off; but she had an object in visiting the other. It was
      noon when she reached the hotel and sat down to dinner in the familiar
      room. She did not know if she was pleased or disappointed to find the meal
      served as well as before, but her thoughts were not cheerful while she
      ate. She remembered her ambitions and her resolve to leave the dreary
      plains and make her mark in Toronto or Montreal. Now her dreams had
      vanished and she must grapple with dull realities that jarred her worse
      than they had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dining-room was clean, but unattractive, with its varnished board
      walls, bare floor, and wire-mesh filling the skeleton door, which a spring
      banged to before the mosquitoes could get in. There were no curtains or
      ventilator-fans, the room was very hot, and the glaring sunshine
      emphasized its ugliness. Then it was full of flies that fell upon boards
      and tables from the poisonous papers, and a big gramophone made a
      discordant noise. Sadie remembered Keller's pride in the machine and how
      he had bought it, to amuse the boys, after hearing an electric organ in a
      Montreal restaurant. Yet she knew her craving for society must be
      gratified at such places as this; a rare visit to the settlement was the
      only change from monotonous toil.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she offered her meal-ticket at the desk the clerk shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't need to open your wallet in this house. The boss left word he'd
      be glad to see you at the store."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie, who had meant to see the proprietor, complied, and found him and
      his wife in the back office, where she and Bob had often sat. The woman
      gave Sadie a friendly smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope they served you well. When you're in town we want you to use the
      house like it still belonged to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie made a suitable reply. She had charged a good price for the
      business, but had stuck to the Keller traditions and made a straight deal.
      Stock and furniture had been justly valued, and when the buyers examined
      the accounts she had frankly told them which debts were doubtful and which
      were probably bad. It was about these things they wished to talk to her,
      and she meant to indulge them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How's trade?" she asked, to give them a lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In one way, it's good," replied the man. "We're selling out as fast as we
      can get the truck; but there's a point I want your views about. The cheque
      I gave you wiped off most all the capital I had, wholesalers put up their
      prices if you make them wait, and a number of the boys have a bad habit of
      letting their bills run on. Now, if you can give me some advice&mdash;&mdash;."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," said Sadie, who thought the woman looked anxious. "Suppose
      you read out the names and what they owe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man opened a ledger, and she told him what she knew about his
      customers; whom he could trust and whom he had better refuse further
      credit. Then she looked thoughtful when he said: "Wilkinson, of the range&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He didn't deal with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you know everybody round here and can tell me if he's likely to make
      good," the man urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much does he owe you?" Sadie asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man named a rather large sum and she pretended to consider.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," she replied, "the boys have probably told you that Wilkinson's not
      a friend of mine, and since that's so I'm not going to say much about his
      character."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not his character we're curious about. Do you know how he's fixed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie was silent for a few moments. The others were young and newly
      married and had admitted that the purchase of the business had strained
      their resources. It was plain that a large bad debt might involve them in
      difficulties. Wilkinson had forced her to fight, and she meant to show him
      no mercy, but she must say nothing that could afterwards be brought up
      against her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Character counts for as much as dollars," she remarked. "That was my
      father's motto, and he was never afraid to take steep chances by backing
      an honest man. Although he had debts on his books for three or four years,
      it was seldom a customer let him down. But he cut out a crook as soon as
      he suspected what the fellow was. However, you want to know how Wilkinson
      stands? Well, it's a sure thing he finds dollars tight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyhow, a man can't disown his debts in this country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so; but if he's a farmer, the homestead laws stop your seizing his
      house and land and part of his stock, unless he has mortgaged them to you.
      If somebody else holds a mortgage, you generally get stung."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The trouble is that if you're too hard on a customer, he tells his
      friends, and the opposition gets his trade and theirs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure," said Sadie, "Keller's let the opposition have that kind of trade.
      A crook's friends are generally like himself, and there's not much profit
      in selling goods to folk who don't mean to pay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has Wilkinson given a mortgage?" the man asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he had, it's got to be registered. You can find out at the record
      office, and I guess it would pay you to go and see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I hear he's just sold a good bunch of horses. That means he'll have
      some money for a while."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you had better take your bills over and get them paid before the
      money's gone," Sadie answered in a meaning tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you had the store, would you risk his being able to pay all right and
      afterwards dropping you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I certainly would," said Sadie. "I'd harness my team and start for the
      range right now."
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman looked at her husband. "That's my notion, Tom; you'd better go,"
      she said, and turned to Sadie. "It would hit us hard if Wilkinson's bill
      got much longer and he let us down."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie left them and went to a new store farther up the street, after which
      she called on an implement dealer who occasionally speculated in real
      estate and mortgages, and one or two others. She knew them all, and they
      knew that on business matters her judgment was sound. It was plain that
      they were suspicious about Wilkinson, but, so far, undecided what to do.
      They had doubts, but hesitated to admit that they had been rash, and
      shrank from using means that might cost them a customer. Sadie gave one
      information she had gathered from another, and added hints of what she
      herself knew. The tact she used prevented their guessing that she had an
      object, and she did little more than bring their own suspicions to a head;
      but she was satisfied when she returned to the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the horse had rested she drove out of the settlement. For some
      distance a wire fence ran along the dusty, graded road, but it ended at a
      hollow, seamed by deep ruts that united on the other side, where a trail
      emerged. Then for a mile or two, she passed new scattered homesteads with
      their windmills and wooden barns, until these dropped behind and she drove
      across the empty wilderness. No rain had fallen, the sky was getting clear
      and green, and a vivid crimson sunset burned on the edge of the grass. The
      air was now cool, and although she was anxious about the weather, Sadie
      felt more cheerful than when she had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had no scruples about what she had done. For one thing, she had kept
      to the truth when she might have made her hints more damaging by a little
      exaggeration. Her antagonist had struck her a treacherous blow; he was
      dangerous, and must be downed. Then she smiled with grim humor as she
      admitted that she had perhaps done enough for a time. Wilkinson's
      creditors were on his track; it would be amusing to watch them play her
      game.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dark when she reached the farm and found Charnock waiting on the
      veranda. He looked dull but not embarrassed, and there was nothing to
      indicate that he had been disturbed by her absence. Sadie did not tell him
      where she had been and did not talk much. She had found out that it was
      better not to make things too easy for Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you have a headache; you deserve it," she said. "I'm tired and
      don't want to hear your excuses now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really haven't begun to make excuses," Charnock answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then don't begin. It's late, and you have got to start for the bluff at
      sun-up and haul those fence-posts home. The job has been hanging on too
      long and must be finished to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be finished before dinner," Charnock replied. "As a matter of
      fact, I brought in most of the posts to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie's look softened, but she did not mean to be gracious yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckoned you'd be loafing round the house and finding fault," she said
      and left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had gone Charnock smiled. Sadie would, no doubt, come round
      to-morrow, and it was lucky she knew nothing about the cheque he had given
      Wilkinson; but he wondered where she had been. Now he came to think of it,
      Wilkinson had said nothing abut the cheque when they met at the railroad
      settlement; but after all there was perhaps no reason he should do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      About seven o'clock one evening a fortnight later, Festing threw down the
      cant-pole he had been using to move a big birch log, and lighting his
      pipe, stopped and looked about. A shallow creek flowed through a ravine at
      the edge of the tall wheat, and below the spot where he stood its channel
      was spanned by the stringers of an unfinished bridge. The creek had shrunk
      to a thread of water, but Festing, who had been wading about its bed, was
      wet and splashed with mire. Moreover he had torn his threadbare overalls
      and his hot face was smeared where he had rubbed off the mosquitoes with
      dirty hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening was hot, he felt tired and moody, and his depression was not
      relieved when he glanced at the wheat. There was no wind now, but the
      breeze had been fresh, and the ears of grain that were beginning to emerge
      from their sheaths dropped in a sickly manner. The stalks had a ragged
      look and fine sand lay among the roots. The crop was damaged, particularly
      along its exposed edge, although it might recover if there was rain.
      Festing, studying the sky, saw no hope of this. The soft blue to the east
      and the luminous green it melted into, with the harsh red glare of the
      sinking sun, threatened dry and boisterous weather. Unless a change came
      soon, the wheat would be spoiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was obvious that he had sown too large a crop, and the work this
      implied had overtaxed his strength. He had felt the strain for some time,
      and now things were going against him it got worse. Hope might have braced
      him, but the thought of failure was depressing. For all that, there were
      economies he must practise at the cost of extra labor, and bridging the
      creek would lessen the cost of transport and enable him to sell one of his
      teams. He was late for supper, but wanted to finish part of the work
      before he went home.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by he saw Helen stop at the edge of the ravine. Her face was hot,
      as if she had been walking fast, and she looked vexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have kept us waiting half an hour and don't seem ready yet," she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not ready," Festing replied, and stopped abruptly. "Very sorry; I
      forgot all about it," he resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen made a gesture of annoyance. She had invited some of their neighbors
      to supper and had spent the day preparing the feast. Things, however, had
      gone wrong; the stove had got too hot and spoiled her choicest dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forgot!" she exclaimed. "It really isn't often I trouble you with
      guests."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's lucky, because I haven't much time for entertaining people. I'm
      overworked just now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen hesitated because she was afraid she might say too much. She admired
      his persevering industry, but had begun to feel that he was slipping away
      from her and devoting himself to his farm. Sometimes she indulged an angry
      jealousy, and then tried to persuade herself it was illogical.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why give yourself another task by building the bridge?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tried to explain that. I can get the thing done with less trouble when
      the creek is nearly dry, and if we had to use the ford when hauling out
      the grain, it would mean starting with a light load or keeping a team of
      horses there. When I've built the bridge and graded back the road we can
      take the full number of bags across, and that makes for economy. It looks
      as if I'll have to be severely economical soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen colored. She thought he did not mean to vex her, but he had ventured
      on dangerous ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know that what is mine is yours," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a way, it is, but I put all my capital into the stock and crop, and
      must try to get it back. I can't ask my wife for money if I loaf about and
      lose my own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't loaf," Helen rejoined. "But if you lose your crop from causes
      you can't prevent happening, there is no reason you shouldn't accept my
      help."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know you're generous and would give me all you had but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen shook her head. "You don't see the matter in the right way yet; but
      we'll let it go. Get your jacket and come back at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must I come?" Festing asked irresolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it obvious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think so. Can't you tell the folks I'd forgotten and started
      something I must finish?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't," said Helen sharply. "It hurts to know you had forgotten. The
      farm is lonely and I haven't many friends; but I can't tell outsiders how
      little that matters to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry," Festing answered with some embarrassment. "Still I think
      you're exaggerating; nobody would look at it like that. Our neighbors know
      one has to stay with one's work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bob finds time to go about with his wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He does," said Festing dryly. "Driving about is easier than farming, and
      Bob has no scruples about living on his wife's money. I expect that was
      his object when he married her. There's another thing I forgot; he's
      coming to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He and Sadie have been at the house some time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing made a sign of resignation. "I could stand the others better. They
      know what we may have to face, but nothing bothers Bob, and it's hard to
      play up to his confounded cheerfulness when you're not in the mood. Then I
      suppose I've got to put on different clothes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen forced a smile. When they first came to the homestead, Stephen had
      changed his clothes for supper and afterwards devoted himself to her
      amusement, sometimes playing chess, and sometimes listening while she
      sang. Then, as the days got longer, he had gradually grown careless,
      contenting himself with changing his jacket and half an hour's talk, until
      at length he sat down to the meal in dusty overalls and hurried off
      afterwards. Helen had tried to make excuses for him, but felt hurt all the
      same. Stephen was getting slovenly and neglecting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's plain that you must take off those muddy overalls," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went back, and supper was delayed while Festing changed. He forced
      himself to be polite when he joined his guests, but it cost him something,
      and the dishes Helen had carefully prepared were spoiled. On the whole, he
      felt grateful to Sadie and Bob, who kept the others in good-humor and
      relieved him from the necessity of leading the talk; but he was glad when
      they left.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the rigs melted into the shadowy plain he stood on the veranda and
      yawned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he remarked, "that's over, and it will be some time before they
      need come back. I hope none of them will think they have to ask us out in
      return."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You gave them a very plain hint," Helen said bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing did not answer and went into the house. He felt he had not been
      tactful, but he was very tired, and if he ventured an explanation might
      make things worse. Besides, he must get up at four o'clock next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen sat still for some time, looking out on the prairie. She was
      beginning to feel daunted by its loneliness. Except for Sadie Charnock,
      visitors seldom came to the farm. Her neighbors lived at some distance,
      but she had hoped to plan a round of small reunions that would break the
      monotony. Stephen, however, had shown her that she could expect no help
      from him, and had actually forgotten her first party. She felt wounded; it
      was hard to think that so long as he had work to do she must resign
      herself to being left alone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      FESTING USES FORCE
    </h3>
    <p>
      A week or so after the supper party Festing started for the settlement
      with some pieces of a binder in his wagon. He had bought the machine
      second-hand, and meant to replace certain worn parts before harvest began,
      although he doubted if this was worth while. The drought was ripening the
      grain prematurely and some of it was spoiled, but he must try to save as
      much as possible. Reaching the edge of the wheat, he stopped the team
      irresolutely, half tempted to turn back, because it seemed unlikely that
      the old binder need be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind had fallen; the mosquitoes were about and bit his face and neck.
      Everything was strangely quiet, it was very hot, and masses of leaden
      cloud darkened the horizon. Festing, however, had given up hoping for
      rain, which would not make much difference if it came now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The front of the wide belt of grain was ragged and bitten into hollows by
      the driving sand. The torn stalks drooped and slanted away from the wind,
      while others that had fallen lay about their roots. Farther in, the damage
      was less, but the ears were half-filled and shriveled. The field was
      parti-colored, for the dull, dark green had changed to a dingy, sapless
      hue, and the riper patches had a sickly yellow tinge instead of a coppery
      gleam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing's face hardened. If he thrashed out half the number of bushels he
      had expected, he would be lucky. He had staked all he had on the chances
      of the weather and had lost. It was his first failure and came as a rude
      shock to his self-confidence. He felt shaken and disgusted with himself,
      for it looked as if he had been a rash fool. Still, if rain came now, he
      might save enough to obviate the necessity of using Helen's money. She
      would give him all he asked for, but this was a matter about which he felt
      strongly, and she knew his point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Driving on, he met the mail-carrier, who gave him a letter. It was from
      Kerr, his former chief on the railroad, who had been moved to a new
      section on the Pacific Slope. He told Festing about certain difficulties
      they had encountered, and the latter felt a curious interest. Indeed, he
      looked back with a touch of regret to the strenuous days he had spent at
      the construction camps. The work was hard, but one was provided with the
      material required and efficient tools. Then there was freedom from the
      responsibility he felt now; one did one's best and the company took the
      risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing's interest deepened when, at the end of the letter, Kerr told him
      about a contract for which nobody seemed anxious to tender. It was a
      difficult undertaking, but Kerr thought a bold, resourceful man could
      carry it out with profit. He did not know if it would appeal to Festing,
      although prairie farmers sometimes went to work with their teams on a new
      track when their harvest was poor. Kerr ended with the hope that this was
      not the case with Festing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter sat still for a few minutes with his brows knit and then
      started his team. It was too late to think of railroad contracts; he had
      chosen his line and must stick to it, but his look was irresolute as he
      drove on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time after Festing reached the settlement, Wilkinson and three or
      four others sat, smoking, in the poolroom. This supplied a useful hint
      about their character, because supper would not be ready for an hour or
      two, and industrious people were busily occupied. The room was hot, the
      floor and green tables were sprinkled with poisoned flies, and the wooden
      chairs were uncomfortably hard, but it was cooler than the sidewalk, and
      the men lounged with their feet on the empty stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does anybody feel like another game?" one asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said the man he looked at. "I've lost three dollars, and that's all
      I can spare. Can't spare it, for that matter, but it's gone. I'm going
      broke if this weather lasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's nothing," remarked another. "Some of us have been broke since we
      came here; you get used to it. There'll be other folks in a tight place if
      the rain doesn't come; but it won't make much difference to you,
      Wilkinson. I guess the storekeepers have you fixed now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson frowned. He knew the remark was prompted by malice because he
      had won the money his companion had lost. The fellow, however, had not
      exaggerated. His creditors had recently stopped supplies and made demands
      with which he was unable to comply, and since they were obviously
      consulting each other, it looked as if he would be sold up and forced to
      leave the neighborhood. Somebody had put them on his track and he
      suspected Mrs. Charnock. He meant to punish her if he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've certainly got to sell off a bunch of young horses sooner than I
      meant; I expect you've seen the notices," he said, and added with a sneer:
      "They'd have made a much better price if I could have kept them until the
      spring, and now's your chance if you have any dollars to invest. It's a
      sure snap for anybody who'll help me hold them over."
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the men laughed ironically and another asked: "Why don't you try
      Charnock? He used to be a partner of yours, and he's more money than the
      rest of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson saw his opportunity. His companions were loafing gossips, and
      those who were married would tell their wives. In a very short time the
      rumor he meant to start would travel about the neighborhood, and there was
      enough truth in it to make it dangerous and hard to deny.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charnock's deadbeat. He's as poor as you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His wife has plenty dollars, anyhow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so, but she's not going to give him any more," Wilkinson rejoined.
      "He married Sadie for her money, and now he hasn't sense enough to stick
      to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was obvious that he had secured the others' attention, for they waited
      eagerly, with their eyes fixed on him. The room was quiet, but a rig came
      up the street and the rattle of wheels and harness drowned the sound of
      steps outside. Nobody noticed that the door, which was not quite shut,
      opened wider.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by that?" one asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bob's running after Mrs. Festing. Old sweetheart of his in England,
      though he turned her down to marry Sadie. Now she's got hold of him again&mdash;tired
      of Festing or has a pick on Mrs. Charnock, perhaps. Anyhow, Bob's round
      the Festing place all the time, and I don't know that I blame him much.
      Mrs. Festing's a looker and Sadie's a difficult woman to live with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what has Festing got to say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson laughed. "Festing's a bit of a sucker and doesn't know. He's
      scared about the big crop he has sown and thinks of nothing but the
      weather and his farm, while Bob goes over when he's off at work. But I
      guess there's trouble coming soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's coming now," said somebody, and Wilkinson's jaw fell slack, and he
      sat with his mouth open as Festing strode into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter had come to look for a smith, and hearing Wilkinson's voice as
      he went up the steps, waited for a moment or two. He was too late, in one
      sense, because the harm had been done, but he could not steal away.
      Although the course he meant to take was not very logical, judgment would
      be given against him if he did nothing. His sunburned face was rather
      white and he stood very stiff, with muscles braced, looking down at
      Wilkinson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get up, you slanderous brute, and tell them it's a lie," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll be shot if I will!" said Wilkinson, who got on his feet reluctantly.
      "You know it's true."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he flung up his arm, a second too late, for Festing struck him a
      smashing blow and he staggered, with the blood running down his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He recovered in a moment, and seizing a billiard cue brought the thick end
      down on Festing's head. Festing swayed, half-dazed, but grasped the cue,
      and they struggled for its possession, until it broke in the middle, and
      Wilkinson flung his end in the other's face. After this, for a minute or
      two, the fight was close and confused, and both made the most of any
      advantage that offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Western Canada, personal combat is not hampered by rules. The main
      thing is to disable one's antagonist as quickly as possible, and Festing
      knew that Wilkinson would not be scrupulous. He must not be beaten,
      particularly since his defeat would, to some extent, confirm the slander.
    </p>
    <p>
      He grappled with Wilkinson as a precaution, because another cue stood
      near, and with a tense effort threw him against the empty stove. The shock
      was heavy enough to bring the stove-pipe down, and a cloud of soot fell
      upon the struggling men, while the pipe rolled noisily across the floor.
      Wilkinson, however, stuck to him, and they reeled up and down between the
      wall and table, getting an arm loose now and then to strike a blow, and
      scattering the chairs. Nobody interfered or cleared the ground, and by and
      by Wilkinson caught his foot and fell down, bringing Festing with him.
      After this, they fought upon the floor, rolling over among the chairs,
      until their grip got slack. Both got up, breathing hard, and Festing
      gasped:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell them you're a liar. It's the last chance you'll get!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson did not answer, but struck him before he could guard, and the
      fight went on again amidst a cloud of dust that rose from the dirty
      boards. Then it ended suddenly, for Festing got his left arm free as he
      forced his antagonist towards the open door. He struck with savage fury,
      and Wilkinson, reeling backwards across the narrow veranda, plunged down
      the stairs and fell into the street. He did not get up, and Festing leaned
      against the wall and wiped his bleeding face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pick up the hog and take him to the hotel," he said, and tried to fill
      his pipe with shaking hands while the rest went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other people joined them in the street, and Festing, stealing away as a
      crowd began to gather, went to the implement store, where he washed his
      face and brushed his damaged clothes. There was a cut on his forehead and
      his jacket was badly torn, while some of the soot that had fallen upon it
      would not come off. After a rest and a smoke, however, he did not feel
      much worse, and the dealer, going to the hotel, brought back news that
      Wilkinson had driven home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess you have done all you could and can let the fellow go," he said.
      "My notion is he won't be in the neighborhood long."
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, Festing drove out of the settlement, with a strip of
      sticking plaster on his forehead and his jacket clumsily mended. The sky
      was now a curious leaden color, and the wild barley shone a livid white
      against the dark riband of the trail; the air was very hot and there was
      not a breath of wind. Festing noted that the horses were nervous and
      trotted fast, although they had made a long journey. Now and then they
      threw up their heads and snorted, and swerved violently when a gopher ran
      across the trail or a prairie-hen got up. The flies seemed to have gone,
      but the mosquitoes were out in clouds, and the hand with which he slapped
      his face and neck was soon smeared with small red stains. He could not
      hold the whip; but it was not needed, because the team rather required to
      be checked than urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the trail permitted he let them go, and swung, lost in gloomy
      thoughts, with the jolting of the rig. The damaging part of Wilkinson's
      statement was false, but since part was true the tale would spread and
      some would believe the worst. It was impossible to doubt Helen, but he was
      angry with her. She had let her ridiculous notion of reforming Bob carry
      her away. Festing did not think Bob could be reformed, but it was Sadie's
      business, not Helen's. Besides, he had objected to her encouraging the
      fellow to hang about the homestead, and she had disregarded his warnings.
      Now, the thing must be stopped, and it would be horribly disagreeable to
      tell her why. She had been obstinate and rash, but after all she meant
      well and would be badly hurt. He began to feel sorry for her, and his
      angry thought's centered on Charnock.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, of course, ridiculous to imagine that Bob was seriously trying to
      make love to Helen; he knew her character too well. All the same, the
      fellow might amuse himself by mild indulgence in romantic sentiment. He
      was a fool and a slacker, and had now humiliated Helen for the second
      time. The longer Festing thought about it, the angrier he got, and when he
      roused himself as the horses plunged down the side of a ravine he was
      surprised to note how far he had gone. He had just time to tighten the
      reins and guide the team across the open log bridge at the bottom, and as
      they plodded up the other side saw that he had better get home as soon as
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drooping leaves of the birches in the hollow flittered ominously, and
      when he reached the summit a bluff that stood out from the plain two or
      three miles off suddenly vanished. It looked as if a curtain had been
      drawn across the grass. The horses set off at a fast trot, and the rig
      jolted furiously among the ruts. It would not be dark for an hour, but the
      gray obscurity that had hidden the bluff was getting near. At its edge and
      about a mile off a pond shone with a strange sickly gleam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a dazzling flash fell from the cloud bank overhead and touched the
      grass. A stunning crash of thunder rolled across the sky, and the team
      plunged into a frantic gallop. Festing braced himself in a vain attempt to
      hold them, for the trail was half covered with tall grass and broken by
      badger holes. He was soon breathless and dazzled, for the lightning fell
      in forked streaks that ran along the plain, and the trail blazed in front
      of the horses' feet. Thunder is common in Canada, but it is on the high
      central plains that the storms attain their greatest violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The team plunged on, and Festing, jolting to and fro, durst not lift his
      eyes from the trail. The storm would probably not last long and might do
      some good if it were followed by moderate rain. But he was not sure that
      moderate rain would fall. By and by a few large drops beat upon his hat,
      there was a roar in the distance, and a cool draught touched his face. It
      died away, but the next puff was icy cold, and the roar got louder. He
      looked up, for he knew what was coming, but there was not a bluff in sight
      that would shield him from the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning down his hat-brim against the increasing rain, he let the horses
      go. He need not try to hold them; the storm would stop them soon. It broke
      upon him with a scream and a shower of sand and withered grass. He
      staggered as if he had got a blow, and then leaned forward to resist the
      pressure. The horses swerved, and he had trouble to keep them on the
      trail, but their speed slackened and they fell into a labored trot. For a
      few minutes they struggled against the gale, and then the roar Festing had
      heard behind the scream drowned the rumbling thunder. He threw up his arm
      to guard his face as the terrible hail of the plains drove down the blast.
    </p>
    <p>
      It fell in oblique lines of ragged lumps of ice, hammering upon the wagon
      and bringing the horses to a stop. They began to plunge, turning half
      round, while one pressed against the other, in an effort to escape the
      savage buffeting. Festing let them have their way at the risk of upsetting
      the rig, and presently they stopped with their backs to the wind. He let
      the reins fall, and the hail beat upon his bowed head and shoulders like a
      shower of stones. The horses stood limp and trembling, as powerless as
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their punishment did not last long. The hail got thinner and the lumps
      smaller; the roar diminished and Festing heard it recede across the plain.
      The wind was still savage, but it was falling, and the thunder sounded
      farther off. There was a savage downpour of drenching rain, and when this
      moderated he pulled himself together, and turning the horses, resumed his
      journey. He was wet to the skin, his shoulders were sore, and his face and
      hands were bruised and cut. Pieces of ice, some as large as hazelnuts, lay
      about the wagon, and the wild barley lay flat beside the trail. Not a
      blade of grass stood upright as far as he could see, and the ruts in which
      the wheels churned were full of melting hail and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was getting dark when his homestead rose out of the plain; a shadowy
      group of buildings, marked by two or three twinkling lights. He was wet
      and cold, but he stopped by the wheat and nerved himself to see what had
      happened to the crop. He had not had much hope, but for all that got
      something of a shock. There was no standing grain; the great field looked
      as if it had been mown. Bruised stalks and torn blades lay flat in a
      tattered, tangled mass, splashed with sticky mud. The rain that might have
      saved him had come too late and was finishing the ruin the sand and hail
      had made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the downpour thickened and the light died out, and he drove to the
      house. He could see in the morning if any remnant of the crop could be
      cut, but there would not be enough to make much difference. Hope had gone,
      and his face was stern when he called the hired man and got down stiffly
      from the dripping rig.

      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HELEN MAKES A MISTAKE
    </h3>
    <p>
      When Festing had changed his clothes he entered the small sitting-room
      with an effort at cheerfulness. The room was unusually comfortable for a
      prairie homestead. The floor was stained, rugs were spread on the polished
      boards, and Helen had drawn the curtains, which harmonized in color with
      the big easy chairs. There were books in well-made cases, and two or three
      good pictures on the painted walls, while a tall brass lamp with a deep
      shade threw down a soft light. Helen had put a meal on the table, and
      Festing sat down with a feeling that was half uneasiness and half content.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he ate he glanced at his wife. She wore a pretty and rather
      fashionable dress that she kept for evenings. She looked fresh and
      vigorous, although the summer had been hot and she worked hard; the
      numerous petty difficulties she had to contend with had left no mark. Her
      courage had always been evident, but she had shown a resolution that
      Festing had not quite expected. He admired it, in a way, but it was
      sometimes awkward when they took a different point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a charm in coming back to a home like this when he was tired and
      disappointed, but its taste and comfort were now disturbing. For one
      thing, he had perhaps not made the best use of his privileges, and, for
      another, Helen might have to be satisfied with a simpler mode of life. It
      hurt him to think of this, because he had hoped to beautify the house
      still further, so that she should miss nothing she had been used to in the
      Old Country. It was obvious that she understood something of his
      misfortune, for her look was sympathetic; but she let him finish his
      supper before she began to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your jacket is badly torn, Stephen," she remarked when he lighted his
      pipe. "And how did you cut your face?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The hail was pretty fierce."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was terrible. We never had storms like that in England. I was
      frightened when I thought of your being out on the prairie. But I don't
      mean the small bruises. How did you cut your forehead?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that!" said Festing awkwardly. "I did it when I fell over a stove at
      the settlement. The pipe came down and I imagine the edge struck me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would have known if it hit you nor not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it might have been the top of the stove. The molding was sharp."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how did you fall against the stove?" Helen persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing did not want to tell her about the fight with Wilkinson. He had
      resolved to say nothing about the matter until morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tripped. There was a chair in the way and it caught my foot."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen did not look altogether satisfied, but let the matter go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has the hail done much damage to the wheat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Festing, with grim quietness. "I imagine it has done all the
      damage that was possible. So far as I could see, the crop's wiped out."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were sitting near together, and Helen, leaning forward, put her hand
      on his arm with a gesture of sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Stephen! I'm dreadfully sorry. It must have been a blow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing's hard look softened. "It was. When I stopped beside the wreck I
      felt knocked out, but getting home braced me up. I begin to feel I might
      have had a worse misfortune and mustn't exaggerate the importance of the
      loss."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen was silent for a few minutes, but she was sensible of a certain
      relief. She was sorry for her husband, but there was some compensation,
      since it looked as if a ray of light had dawned on him. Although she had
      struggled against the feeling, she was jealous of the farm that had kept
      him away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you sowed too large a crop, and you could not have gone on
      working as you have done," she said. "It would have worn you out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing put down his pipe and looked at her with surprise. "You don't seem
      to understand that I'll have to work harder than before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand," said Helen, taking away her hand. "To begin with,
      it's impossible; then I'd hoped the loss of money, serious as it is, would
      have made you cautious and, in a sense, more content."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You hoped the loss of the money&mdash;!" Festing exclaimed. "Did you ever
      know losing money make anybody content? The thing's absurd!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen made a gesture of protest. "Stephen, dear, try to see what I mean.
      You have been doing too much, running too big risks, and fixing all your
      thought upon the farm. It has made you irritable and impatient, and the
      strain is telling on your health. This could not go on long, and although
      I'm truly sorry the wheat is spoiled, it's some relief to know you will be
      forced to be less ambitious. Besides, it's foolish to be disturbed.
      Neither of us is greedy, and we have enough. In fact, we have much that I
      hardly think you value as you ought."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't enough; that's the trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," said Helen, "you know that all I have belongs to both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It doesn't," Festing answered in a stubborn tone. "You don't seem to
      realize yet that I can't change my views about this matter. I've lost most
      of my money, but that's no reason I should lose my wife's. Besides, since
      you bought the farm, you haven't a large sum left." He paused and
      indicated the handsome rugs and furniture. "Then it costs a good deal to
      live up to this kind of thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can change that; I can manage with less help and be more economical.
      There is much that we can go without. I wouldn't mind at all, Stephen, if
      it would help you to take things easily."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing colored. "No. I can't let you suffer for my rashness. It's my
      business to give you all the comforts you need."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Helen, "I like you to think of me. But something's due to
      pride. I wonder how much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," said Festing, rather wearily. "I'm what I am and haven't
      much time to improve myself. For that matter, I'll have less time now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then what do you mean to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Make the most of what I have left. I'd hoped to give you a change this
      winter&mdash;take you to Montreal and go skating and tobogganing, but
      that's done with. I believe I have money enough to begin again in a small
      way and work up. It may take me two or three years to get back to where I
      was, but somehow I will get back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you are going on as before; concentrating all your mind upon the
      farm, taking no rest, denying yourself every pleasure you might have had?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid that's the only way. It's a pretty grim outlook, but I think I
      can stand the strain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I suppose I must try," said Helen, very quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent afterwards, and Festing lit his pipe. Something stood
      between them, and she felt that it was not less dangerous because their
      motives were good. Had they differed from selfishness, agreement might
      have been easier, but an estrangement that sprang from principle was hard
      to overcome. She wanted to help her husband and keep him to herself; he
      meant to save her hardship and carry out a task that was properly his. But
      perhaps their motives were not so fine as they looked. Suppose there was
      shabby jealousy on her side, and false pride on his? Well, Stephen was
      tired and could not see things in the proper light, and it was some relief
      when he got up and went out. Helen picked up a book, in the hope of
      banishing her uneasy thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Festing came in for breakfast, feeling gloomy and
      preoccupied. He had not slept much and got up early to examine the damaged
      grain. It looked worse than he had thought and, for the most part, must be
      burned off the ground. There were patches that might, with difficulty, be
      cut, but he hardly imagined the stooks would pay for thrashing. Moreover,
      he had bought and fed a number of expensive Percheron horses, which ought
      to have been used for harvesting and hauling the grain to the railroad,
      and had engaged men at lower wages than usual, on the understanding that
      he kept them through the winter. Now there was nothing for both to do,
      although their maintenance would cost as much as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      He read Kerr's letter again. If he had not been married, it would have
      given him a chance of overcoming his difficulties. A man and a team of
      horses could do all that was required on the farm in winter, and he could
      have taken the others to British Columbia. Kerr would arrange for free
      transport, and, if he was lucky, he might earn enough on the railroad to
      cover part of his loss. But this was impossible. He could not leave Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was the other matter. He had not yet told her what Wilkinson
      had said, but she must be told, and Bob's visits must stop. The trouble
      was that he had already vexed her by refusing her help, and this would not
      make his delicate task easier. Besides, he was not in the mood to use much
      tact. His nerves were raw; the shock he had got had left him savage and
      physically tired. For all that, the thing could not be put off.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said nothing until breakfast was over, and then, asking Helen to come
      with him, went on to the veranda. The sun was hot, the sky clear, and thin
      steam drifted across the drenched plain. Had the storm come without the
      hail a few weeks sooner, it would have saved his crop; but now the
      vivifying moisture seemed to mock him. It had come too late; the wheat had
      gone. Struggling with a feeling of depression, he turned to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's something we must talk about; and I hope you'll be patient with
      me if you get a jar."
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned against the balustrade, nervously fingering his pipe, and Helen
      sat down opposite. She felt curious and disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To begin with, I'll tell you what happened at the settlement yesterday.
      You must remember that the statements are Wilkinson's."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen's color rose, and when he stopped her face was flushed and her eyes
      were very bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," she said in a strained voice. "But what did you do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing smiled rather grimly. "I dragged the brute about the floor and
      threw him into the street. I don't know that it was a logical denial of
      the slander, but it was what the others expected and I had to indulge
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that was how you cut your forehead?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Festing, and for a few moments Helen tried to regulate her
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt shocked and disgusted, but did not mean to let her anger master
      her, because there were matters that must be carefully weighed. Indeed, it
      was something of a relief to dwell upon the first. To hear of Festing's
      thrashing her traducer had given her a pleasant thrill, but all the same
      she vaguely disapproved. He had not taken a dignified line and had really
      made things worse. It was humiliating to feel that she had been the
      subject of a vulgar poolroom brawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could you not have found a better way to silence him?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could not. I was afraid you wouldn't like it, but you must try to
      understand that I was forced to play up to local sentiment. English
      notions of what is becoming don't hold good here; you can't stop a man
      like Wilkinson with a supercilious look. If I'd let the thing go, the boys
      would have thought his statements true, and the tale is bad enough to deal
      with."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen gave him a steady look, but her color was high and her face was
      hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you know it isn't true!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," said Festing, with quiet scorn. "All that the brute
      insinuated is absolutely false. Bob's a fool, but he knows you, and I'm
      beginning to think he's a little in love with his wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Helen, "I knew you knew. But I felt I must hear you say so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing hesitated. One difficulty had vanished, but there was another, and
      he hoped Helen would see his point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For all that, in a way, there was some truth in the story; enough, in
      fact, to make it dangerous, and I think you have been rash. Bob has been
      here too often, and you will remember I objected to his coming."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did," said Helen. "You were rather disagreeable about it; but you
      objected because he liked to talk and kept you from your work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He certainly talked. General conversation is all right in English country
      houses where nobody had much to do, but casual chatterers who insist on
      talking when you're busy are a disgusting nuisance in Canada. However, I
      don't think that's worth arguing about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not," said Helen, with a smile. "Besides, I know your opinions
      about that point. What do you wish me to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Warn Sadie to keep Bob at home. There's no reason she shouldn't visit
      you, but you can't go there."
    </p>
    <p>
      The color returned to Helen's face and she got up. She looked stately with
      her air of injured pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean that I should rule my conduct to suit the ideas of the
      drunken loafers at the settlement poolroom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said Festing impatiently, "try to be sensible! You have done a
      foolish thing, but you needn't make it worse. The trouble is that those
      loafers' opinions will be reflected all round the neighborhood. Wilkinson
      won't say anything more; at least, he won't when I'm about; but I can't
      keep on throwing out people who agree with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is plain. If you were not so angry, the remark would be humorous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not angry," Festing rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I am," said Helen. "And I think I have some grounds. Must I let
      those tipsy gossips dictate when I may see my friends?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does it matter if you see them or not? You don't really care for Bob."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Helen, trying to be calm. "In a way, I don't care for Bob; that
      is, I'm glad I didn't marry him. But I don't see why I should stop him
      coming here when Sadie wants to bring him. She's my friend, and she knows
      it does Bob good. I'm too angry to flatter you, Stephen, but you have some
      influence&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing laughed. "All the influence I've got won't go far with Bob. I
      don't say the fellow's vicious, but he's an extravagant slacker and a
      fool, which is perhaps as bad. Anyhow, if he can be reformed at all, it's
      Sadie's business, and I've no doubt she finds it an arduous job. There's
      no use in an outsider meddling, and your anxiety for his improvement might
      be misunderstood. In fact, it has been seriously misunderstood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to have made up your mind about the matter," Helen remarked with
      a curious look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have. Perhaps the easiest way would be for you to give Sadie a hint."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose I refuse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I shall have to talk to Bob. After all, that might be better."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen flushed, but her color faded and her face got white. "You are
      willing to let this scurrilous gossip influence you as far as that? Do you
      mean to forbid my friends coming to see me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't have Bob hanging round my house. The wastrel has done you harm
      enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forget something," Helen rejoined in a strained, cold voice. "The
      house is mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew her mistake as she saw the change in Festing's look, and weakly
      turned her head. When she looked back it was too late. His hands were
      clenched and his gaze was fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I didn't quite mean that," she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyhow, it's true," said Festing quietly. "The farm is yours as well, and
      I admit you have no grounds for being satisfied with the way I've managed
      your property. You won't have much trouble in getting a better steward."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen glanced at him, with a hint of fear. "But I don't want anybody else.
      Do you mean to give up the farm?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. As soon as I can arrange things for you I'm going to British
      Columbia for a time. I've been offered a railroad contract, and as it's a
      job I know something about, I mayn't fail at that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you will leave me alone to face this slander?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The remedy's in your hands. I'm powerless if you won't use it. I can't
      forbid Bob coming here; you can."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen hesitated. It was unfortunate that both were in an abnormal mood.
      They had borne some strain, and the shock of the disaster to the crop had
      left them with jangled nerves. This clouded Helen's judgment, but
      reenforced her pride. She had meant well when she tried to help Sadie with
      Bob, and could not give way to her husband's unreasonable prejudice. This
      was a matter of principle. She could help Bob and must not be daunted by
      vulgar gossip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she said; "I can't break my promise to Sadie for the reasons you
      give. You must do what you think best."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing made a sign of acquiescence and went down the steps, while Helen
      bit her lip. She wanted to call him back, but somehow could not. It might
      be easier if he would look round, but he went on across the grass and his
      step was resolute, although his head was bent. Then she got up, and going
      to her room, sat down trembling. She had let her best chance go; Stephen's
      resolve would stiffen, for when he had made a choice he was hard to move.
      Besides, he had wounded her deeply. He did not seem to understand that if
      he went away he would give people ground for thinking the slander true. He
      ought to have seen this if he had thought about her. Perhaps he had seen
      it and refused to let it influence him. Well, if he wanted a
      reconciliation, he must make the first offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Festing went to look for the foreman, whom he could
      trust. After some talk, the man agreed to manage the farm for the winter
      on the terms Festing indicated. Then the latter asked if the other men
      would go with him to the Pacific Slope, and finding them willing, went
      back to his office and carefully studied his accounts. He was glad to
      think that Helen had sufficient help and that the staid Scottish
      housekeeper would take care of her. By and by he wrote a note and then
      drove off to the settlement. He did not come back until next morning, but
      his plans were made and he only waited a telegram from Kerr. Three or four
      days later the telegram arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All fixed," it ran. "Pass for transport mailed. Come along soon as
      possible."

      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      SADIE SEES A WAY
    </h3>
    <p>
      Soon after Festing started for British Columbia Sadie drove over to the
      farm; because she had heard about the fight in the poolroom and suspected
      why he had gone. At first she found it difficult to break down Helen's
      reserve, but the latter could not resist her frank sympathy, and softening
      by degrees, allowed herself to be led into confidential talk. Sadie waited
      until she thought she understood the matter, and then remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you stuck to your promise that you'd help me with Bob, although you
      saw what it would cost? Well, I wouldn't be surprised if you hated us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It wasn't altogether the promise," Helen replied. "We were both highly
      strung, and I thought Stephen hard and prejudiced; it seemed ridiculous
      that he should care what the loafers said. But I don't hate you. The fault
      was really mine, and I want a friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Sadie, "I feel I've got to help put this trouble right, if I
      can." She paused and asked with some hesitation: "Will Steve be away
      long?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," Helen answered dejectedly. "He hinted that he might not
      come until spring; I think he means to stop until he has earned enough to
      make him independent. That's partly my fault&mdash;I said something rash.
      If I hadn't had more money than him, it wouldn't have happened."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie smiled. "My having more money won't make trouble between me and Bob;
      he doesn't mind how much I've got. But I suppose you want Steve back?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course! It's all I want, but the matter is not as simple as it looks.
      I don't think he will come back as long as he's poor, and if he does, he
      won't use my capital, and things will be as before. If he earns some
      money, I should feel hurt because he was obstinate and wouldn't let me
      help. That's why I don't know what to do. I wish I'd never had the money!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie thought Helen had some ground she had not mentioned yet for her
      distress. Moreover, it looked as if she still felt she had a grievance
      against Festing, and their clashing ideas about the money did not
      altogether account for this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess you're keeping something back."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen's reserve had broken down. She was half ashamed because she had lost
      it, but she felt the need of sympathy, and Sadie could be trusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He didn't see, or didn't mind, that his going away would bear out the
      wicked story!" she exclaimed with sparkling eyes. "I feel that was the
      worst."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know that it looks quite as bad as you think. It's a common thing
      for a farmer who has lost his crop to go off and work on a new railroad,
      particularly if he has teams the construction boss can use. Anyhow, I
      guess the thing will come right, and I'll help if I can. But I want to see
      my way before I move."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen did not answer, and soon afterwards Sadie left the homestead. She
      said nothing to Charnock about her visit, but started for the settlement
      next morning and informed herself about what had happened at the poolroom
      and what people thought. Then she drove home, and getting back at dusk,
      sat down opposite Charnock, who lounged in a basket chair with a pipe in
      his mouth. Her eyes twinkled with rather grim humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't look as if anything bothered you," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's possible," Charnock agreed. "I suppose I'm lucky because I have
      nothing much to bother about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wouldn't bother about it, anyhow. You leave that kind of thing to
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock gave her a quick glance. She was not angry, which was something
      of a relief, because Sadie was difficult when she let herself go. Besides,
      he was not conscious of having done anything to vex her since he gave
      Wilkinson the cheque. But she looked resolute.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've a good excuse," he answered. "I've got a remarkably capable wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll cut out the compliments. I don't think you have seen any of the
      boys from the settlement since Festing left."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock said he had not done so, and she gave him a thoughtful look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you can't remember when you last did something useful;
      something that would help somebody else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a painful confession, but I can't remember. Still I've some
      experience of being helped along a way I didn't want to go, which leads me
      to believe it's often kinder to leave folks alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyhow, you have done some harm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid that's true. I don't know that I meant to do much harm, but
      it's generally easier than doing good. For example, I've given you some
      trouble; but at the moment I can't think of a new offense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can quit joking and put down that newspaper. It looks as if you
      didn't know why Festing left?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock said he could not guess, and got up abruptly when Sadie told him.
      He kicked the newspaper out of his way and crossed the floor with angry
      strides. His face was red when he stopped in front of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't believe the lying tale!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Sadie, calmly. "If I had believed it, I wouldn't have talked to
      you like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you! Now we have cleared the ground, I'm certainly going to do
      something. I'll begin by driving over to Wilkinson's to-morrow, and I'll
      take a whip."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Festing 'tended to that matter before he left, and making another circus
      won't help. Besides, Wilkinson has got to quit. You'll see notices about
      his sale soon; I fixed that up."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock laughed. "You're a marvel, Sadie, but the brute deserves it.
      Well, if I mustn't thrash him, what's your plan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll go to British Columbia and bring Festing back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will, by George!" said Charnock. "We owe him and Helen much, and the
      job is obviously mine&mdash;by joining Festing I give Wilkinson the lie.
      You're clever, and I expect you saw this. Anyhow, I'll start; but
      Festing's an obstinate fellow. Suppose he won't come back?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He mayn't at first. If so, you'll have to wait."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock turned away and walked about the floor while Sadie watched him,
      pleased but curious. Bob was rather hard to move, but he was moved now. He
      came back, and sitting down, looked at her thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I imagine you are giving me a bigger job than you know. If Festing has
      taken the railroad contract, he'll probably stop until he had carried it
      out. Now I don't imagine I'd find it amusing to loaf about and watch him
      work; for one thing, it's pretty cold in the ranges after the snow comes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" said Sadie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock leaned forward with an apologetic smile. "I'd like to take a
      share in the contract and help him through; that is, of course, if he
      won't come back at once. But there's a difficulty; I haven't the cash."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You want me to give you some?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I shouldn't feel much surprised if you refused. I've squandered your
      money before, but this time I mean business. Can't you see that I have, so
      to speak, got my chance at last?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't quite see. You have had many chances."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have," Charnock agreed; but there was a new note in his voice and a
      look in his eyes that Sadie had not often seen. "I've been a fool, but
      perhaps it doesn't follow that I'm incapable of change. However, let's be
      practical. The crop is spoiled, we have no grain to haul in, and there'll
      be nothing doing here while the snow is on the ground. Well, if Festing
      can get some of his money back, why can't I? I've wasted yours long
      enough, and now, if I can't bring him home, I'll stop with him until we
      both make good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean that, Bob?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do. Give me a chance to prove it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie got up, and putting her hands on his shoulders, kissed him. "Very
      well. You shall have all the money you want."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she went back to her chair and turned her head. She had borne with
      her husband's follies and fought hard for him, sometimes with hope and
      sometimes in desperation, but always with unflinching courage. Now it
      looked as if she had won. Victory was insecure yet, and there was a risk
      that it might turn to defeat, but Sadie never shrank from a daring
      venture. For a moment she could not speak; her heart was full.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo!" said Charnock, who got up and came towards her. "Crying, Sadie?
      Will you miss me as much as that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie hastily wiped her eyes. "Yes, Bob; I'll miss you all the time. But
      if you'll come back the man you are now, I'll wait as long as you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll try," said Charnock simply. "I'm not going to protest, but you
      deserve a much better husband than you've got. If I can't come back better
      fit to live with you, I won't come back at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't like that," Sadie answered, smiling uncertainly. "But I guess
      I know what you mean. I'll wait, dear, because I know you are going to
      make good."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, feeling that she had said enough, she began to make plans. Something
      might be saved from the ruined crop and she had better keep a heavy team,
      but Charnock could have the other horses if they were required. She could
      carry on whatever work was possible after the frost set in, and would pay
      off one of the hired men. Charnock approved, and after a time Sadie leaned
      back in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all fixed, but perhaps we mayn't need these plans," she said.
      "Remember you're really going there to bring Festing home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's understood. However, I don't think he'll come, and if so, it will
      be Helen's money that prevents him. If he's foolish enough to doubt her, I
      can put him right, which will be something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Sadie, with a sigh. "Well, if he won't come, you must stop and
      do the best you can."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Festing reached the railroad camp. It was raining when
      the construction train rolled noisily through a mountain gorge, and he
      stood at the door of the caboose, looking out. Three or four hundred feet
      below, a green river, streaked with muddy foam, brawled among the rocks,
      for the track had been dug out of a steep hillside. Festing knew this was
      difficult work; one could deal with rock, although it cost much to cut,
      but it was another matter to bed the rails in treacherous gravel, and the
      fan-shaped mounds of shale and soil that ran down to the water's edge
      showed how loose the ground was and the abruptness of the slope. Above,
      the silver mist drifted about the black firs that clung to the side of the
      mountain, and in the distance there was a gleam of snow. Some of the trees
      had fallen, and it was significant that, for the most part, they did not
      lie where they fell. They had slipped down hill, and the channels in the
      ground indicated that the shock had been enough to start a miniature
      avalanche which had carried them away. The pitch was near the slant
      engineers call the angle of rest, but Festing thought there was rock not
      far beneath, which prevented the solidification of the superincumbent
      soil. It looked as if his contract would be difficult and he would earn
      his pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the cars passed he saw the ballast creep about the ends of the ties,
      which reached to the edge of the descent, and in places small streams of
      gravel had run down, leaving hollows round the timber. The harsh jolting
      indicated the consequences, but he knew that in the West railroads are
      built as fast as possible and made safe afterwards. For that matter, he
      had often run risks that would have daunted engineers used to conservative
      English methods. In the meantime, the speed was slackening, and by and by
      the harsh tolling of the locomotive bell echoed among the pines. Tents,
      iron huts, and rude log shacks slipped past; men in muddy slickers drew
      back against the bank, and then the train stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing got down into the water that flowed among the ties, and Kerr came
      forward in dripping slickers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you want help to get the teams out, I'll send some of the boys," he
      said. "If not, you had better come along and I'll show you your shack. I
      told our cook to fix your supper, and I'll be glad to sit down for a time
      out of the wet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing followed him along the descending track, which presently ended at
      a ledge of rock sixty or seventy feet above the river. Wire ropes spanned
      the gap between the banks, and near the middle a rock islet broke the
      surface of the savage flood. Here men were pouring cement into holes among
      the foundations of an iron frame, while suspended trollies clanged across
      the wires. On the other bank was a small flat where shacks of log and bark
      stood among dripping tents. The roar of the river filled the gorge, but
      its deep note was broken by the rattle of hammers, clash of shovels, and
      clang of thrown-down rails.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sounds of keen activity stirred Festing's blood. He had a touch of
      constructive genius, but lack of specialized training had forced him into
      the ranks of the pioneers. Others must add the artistic finish and divide
      the prizes of ultimate victory; his part was to rough out the work and
      clear the way. But he was satisfied with this, and something in him
      thrilled as he heard in the crash of a blasting charge man's bold
      challenge to the wilderness. Kerr waited with a twinkle of understanding
      amusement while Festing looked about, and then took him up the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have come back," he remarked. "Well, I guessed you would come. After
      all, this is your job; it's here you belong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is so, in a sense," Festing dryly agreed. "It looks as if my job was
      to get tired and wet and dirty while others got the dollars; but it's a
      job with different sides. Farming's as much a part of it as this, and has
      very similar disadvantages."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's an altruistic theory that the dollars don't count; but it's
      easier to believe when you draw your wages regularly, and I've known it
      break down when an engineer was offered a more lucrative post. Anyhow, I
      reckon it's our business to make good, even if our pay isn't equal to our
      desserts, which happens pretty often when you work on the railroad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you work on a farm, you often don't get paid at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kerr laughed and indicated the pines that rolled up the hill in somber
      spires.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there's your raw material, and you won't have much trouble to bring
      the logs down, though you may find stopping them from plunging into the
      river a harder thing. However, you have some notion of what you're up
      against, and I'll show you the plans and specifications when we get out of
      the rain."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped in front of a small log shack, and opening the door, beckoned
      Festing in. There was an earth floor, and a bunk, filled with swamp-hay,
      was fixed to the wall; two or three camp-chairs stood about, and a fire of
      scented cedar logs burned on the clay hearth. A Chinaman, dressed in very
      clean blue clothes, was putting a meal on the table. Festing hung up his
      wet slickers and sat down with a vague sense of satisfaction. It was plain
      that he must go without many comforts he had enjoyed at the farm, but he
      felt strangely at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kerr took supper with him, and afterwards threw some papers on the table
      and lighted his pipe. Half an hour later Festing looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I imagine I've got the hang of things, and I'll make a start to-morrow.
      Your way of underpinning the track is pretty good, but I don't like that
      plan. You can't hold up the road long with lumber; the work won't stand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know if your objection springs from artistic delight in a good
      job or British caution. Anyhow, you ought to know that in this country we
      don't want work to stand; our aim is to get it finished. If the track
      holds up until we can start the freight traffic running, it's as much as
      we expect. We'll improve it afterwards as the dollars come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A freight train in a Canadian river isn't a very uncommon object,"
      Festing rejoined. "However, it's my business to cut the logs and do the
      underpinning as well as I can. On the whole, and barring accidents, I see
      some profit on the job. I'm grateful to you for putting it in my way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your thanks are really due to somebody else. The head contractor is not
      allowed to sub-let work without our approval, and although I recommended
      your being given a chance, the decision rested with another man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'll probably look you up to-night," Kerr replied with a twinkle. "They
      sent him from headquarters to see how we're getting on. But I'll leave you
      the plans. We're working nights with the blast-lamps, and I've got to be
      about when the new shift makes a start."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went away and Festing studied the drawings. He had undertaken to cut
      and dress to size the heavy logs required for the lower posts of trestles
      and foundation piles. So far, he did not apprehend much difficulty, but he
      would run some risk over the underpinning of part of the track. In order
      to make a secure and permanent road-bed, it would have been necessary to
      cut back the hillside for some distance and then distribute the spoil
      about the slope below, but the engineers had chosen a quicker and cheaper
      plan. Heavy timbers would be driven into the face of the hill to make a
      foundation for the track, which would be partly dug out of, and partly
      built on to, the declivity. Where the main piles reached the rock the plan
      would be safe, but where they were bedded in gravel there was danger of
      their giving way under a heavy load. Festing knew he must share the risk
      of this happening with the head contractor.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by somebody knocked at the door, and he got up abruptly as a man
      came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dalton!" he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other smiled and threw off his wet slickers. It was getting dark, but
      the firelight touched his face and Festing studied him with surprise. The
      lad, whom he had not seen for some years, had grown into a man, and had
      moreover a look of quiet authority. He had made rapid progress if he had,
      as Kerr had stated, been sent to report upon the latter's work.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't seem to have expected me, though, to some extent, I'm
      responsible for your being here," he said. "However, I'm remarkably glad
      we have met again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing, awkwardly conscious that his welcome was somewhat cold, indicated
      a chair, and sitting down opposite began to fill his pipe. Dalton
      sometimes wrote to Helen, but had not mentioned his being sent to British
      Columbia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said, "I was glad to hear you had got a move up once or twice,
      but it looks as if you had gone farther than I thought."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had the advantage of a proper training, and the reputation of the
      engineer who gave it me counted for something, although I might never have
      got my chance in this country but for you. Now I'm happy if I've been able
      to show my gratitude. When Kerr brought your name forward I told him to
      see you got the contract."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did more than you knew," said Festing. "It looks as if you hadn't
      heard from Helen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not for a time; I hope she's well. I'd thought about coming West to see
      you, but couldn't get away, and she talked about your going to Montreal
      this winter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's off, of course. It's plain you don't know that Helen and I have
      quarreled."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dalton looked up sharply, but was silent for a moment or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is a nasty knock," he said. "I don't know if my relation to you
      justifies my venturing on dangerous ground, but do you feel at liberty to
      tell me what you quarreled about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing decided that Charnock's part in the matter must be kept dark. It
      was unthinkable that Dalton should imagine he suspected his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To put it roughly, we differed about what you might call a principle,
      although Helen's money had something to do with the thing. You see, I lost
      my crop and she was hurt because I wouldn't use her capital."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see altogether," Dalton rejoined. "In fact, your objection seems
      unusual."
    </p>
    <p>
      He pondered for a minute or two, and Festing marked the change in him.
      Dalton had a reserve and thoughtfulness he had not expected. He had grown
      very like Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A quarrel about a principle is apt to be dangerous," he resumed.
      "Although you are probably both wrong, you can persuade yourselves you are
      right. Then while I was glad to hear about your wedding, I'll admit that I
      saw some difficulties. Helen has a strong will and is sometimes rather
      exacting, while you're an obstinate fellow and a little too practical. I
      must wait until I know more than I do now, but might be of some use as a
      peacemaker. Isn't it possible to compromise? Can't you meet half way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in the meantime. I can't go home until I'm able to run the farm
      without your sister's help. There's some risk of her despising me if I did
      go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may be right; I can't judge," Dalton thoughtfully agreed. "Now I
      could, of course, find an excuse for getting you dismissed, but I know you
      both too well to imagine that plan would work. You would go somewhere
      else, while though Helen is generous there's a hard streak in her. I
      really think she'd like you better afterwards if you carried your
      intentions out."
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused and smiled. "She got the money you object to in a very curious
      way&mdash;by refusing to indulge the wishes of our only rich relation. I
      was more compliant because his plans met my views, and he paid for my
      education, but when he died we found Helen had got her share and mine. I
      understand he told his lawyer that he still thought her wrong; but if she
      thought she was right, she was justified in refusing, and he admired her
      pluck."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has pluck," said Festing. "On the whole I don't think that makes
      things much better for me. Anyhow, I've taken this contract and I've got
      to stay with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll help you as far as I can," said Dalton, who soon afterwards left the
      shack.

      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      FESTING GETS TO WORK
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mist rolled among the pines and it was raining hard when Festing led his
      team down the hill. He wore big rubber boots and slickers, and a heavy log
      trailed behind the horses through the mud. Some distance above the river
      the slope was gradual, and it was necessary to haul the logs to the
      skidway he had built. They would then run down without help; indeed, the
      difficulty was to stop them when they reached the track. Festing was wet
      and dirty, and the sweating horses were splashed. When he stopped to
      unhook the chain, three or four men came up with cant-poles, and
      struggling in the churned-up mire, rolled the log to the top of the
      incline.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shallow, undulating trough scored the hillside, crossed at short
      intervals by small logs, split up the middle and laid with their round
      sides on top. It looked something like a switchback railway, only that
      while the incline varied, all the undulations ran down hill. A few logs
      rested insecurely on the top skids, and the men put the one Festing had
      brought below the rest. Then they threw down their poles and Festing
      looked about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Water filled the hollows in the wavy line of skids, which vanished at the
      edge of a steeper dip and reappeared below, to plunge out of sight again.
      Its end was banked up with wet gravel near the track. Festing could not
      see the track, but the opposite side of the river was visible, with the
      island, near which two wire-ropes skimmed the surface of the flood. A man
      stood on the skids about half way down and presently waved his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Watch out below!" he shouted and signed to Festing. "All clear! You can
      start her off."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing seized a handspike and the skids groaned as the big log began to
      move. The men helped and sprang back as it gathered speed. Water flew up,
      the bark tore off in crumpled flakes, and the wet timber smoked. The other
      logs were smaller and easier launched, but they did not gain the momentum
      of the first, which plunged furiously down hill and flung up its thin end
      as it leaped over the edge of the dip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's surely hitting up the pace," one of the men remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The mud is greasing the skids," said Festing, who began to run down the
      incline when the man below shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of the others followed, but stopped at the top of the last pitch,
      which ended in the bank of gravel close above the track. The logs, spread
      out at intervals, rushed down, rising and falling on the uneven skids.
      Showers of mud and water marked their progress; there was a crash as a
      smashed skid was flung into the air, and a roar when the leading mass
      plowed through fallen gravel. Stones shot out and Festing saw smoke and
      sparks, but the logs rushed on, and he wondered anxiously whether the bank
      would stop them. So far, it had served its purpose, but he was doubtful
      about it now, and hoped there was nobody on the track beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big log reached the bank and ran half way up the short incline before
      its speed slackened much. Festing held his breath as he watched, for some
      gravel cars had come down the track, and he could not tell where they
      were. The log was going slower, but he doubted if it would stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      It plowed on through the gravel, which shot up all round, and then the end
      of the bank seemed to fall away. There was a shower of stones; the butt of
      the log went down and its after end tilted up. Then it lurched out of
      sight and there was a heavy crash below. After this Festing heard a
      confused din, and imagined, though he could not see, the mass of timber
      plunging down the precipitous slope, smashing rocks and scattering gravel
      as it went. The noise stopped, he heard a splash, and as the following
      logs leaped the broken bank, the first shot half its length out of water,
      and falling again, drove down stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rope at the island caught it while a trolley ran down, but the
      straining wire curved and parted, and the trolley fell into the river as
      the log swept on. The others followed and vanished in a turmoil of muddy
      foam, and Festing went down to the track. Things might have been worse,
      for nobody was hurt, although some yards of road-bed had been carried away
      and a derrick he had built to put the logs on the cars was smashed. As he
      studied the damage a wet and angry engineer ran up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have got to stop your blamed logs jumping down like that! They've
      broken a steel rope and there's a new trolley-skip in the river!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry," Festing answered. "I'll try to get the skip out as soon as
      possible, and you can trust me to stop more logs getting away, for my own
      sake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There'll be trouble if you let your lumber loose on me, and I want the
      skip soon," said the other. "A stranger asked for you a few minutes ago
      and I sent him up the hill."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went away and Festing's men came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty rough luck, boss!" one remarked. "What are we going to do about
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll grade up the gravel dump to begin with, and then make a new
      derrick," Festing answered gloomily. "It doesn't look as if I'd get much
      profit on the first week's work."
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved off, and as he scrambled up the bank met a man coming down. Both
      stopped abruptly and Festing frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What in thunder has brought you, Bob?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They told me you were up the hill," Charnock said, smiling. "I came in on
      the last construction train."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why did you come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you mean&mdash;Why did I come to bother you again? Well, the
      explanation will take some time, and it's confoundedly muddy and raining
      hard. When are you likely to be unoccupied?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing tried to control his annoyance. The accident had disturbed him and
      he was not pleased to see Charnock, whom he did not wish to make free of
      his shack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you been doing since you arrived?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sitting in the bunk-house and waiting for the rain to stop. Then I got
      dinner with the boys, and afterwards went to see a rather nice young
      fellow called Dalton. I told him I was a friend of yours, and he half
      promised to give me a job."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't seem to know who he is?" Festing remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't; but I thought he looked hard at me when he heard my name.
      However, don't disturb yourself on my account; I'm pretty comfortable in
      the bunk-house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. You had better come to my shack when work stops. I can't leave
      my men now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock strolled off with his usual languid air, and Festing resumed his
      work. He could not imagine what Charnock wanted, but wished he had stopped
      away. In the meantime, he had much to do and drove his men hard, until a
      steam-whistle hooted and they threw down their tools. His supper was ready
      when he reached the shack, but Charnock had not arrived, and although this
      was something of a relief, he felt annoyed. He had told him to come when
      work stopped, but the fellow was never punctual. An hour later Charnock
      walked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought I'd better wait until after supper," he said. "My coming now
      leaves you more at liberty to turn me out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To begin with, I'd like to know why you came at all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sadie thought it was time I did something useful, and I agreed. It's
      obvious that if anything useful can be done, I'm the proper person to
      undertake the job. Now you understand me, shall I go on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing nodded. Charnock's careless good humor had vanished; he looked
      embarrassed but resolute, as if he meant to carry out a disagreeable task.
      This was something new for Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," the latter resumed. "In order to clear the ground, do you
      imagine I'm in love with your wife?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure Helen is not in love with you," Festing rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's much, but we have got to talk about the other side of the matter,"
      said Charnock quietly. "I went to your home with Sadie because I thought
      she and Helen could learn something from each other; while I suspect she
      thought your society was good for me. It's obvious that Helen agreed, and
      Sadie and I will always be grateful for her staunchness in sticking to us,
      although you disliked it. Whether I'm worth the quarrel or not is another
      thing. I hope you understand me as far as I've gone."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing made a sign and Charnock continued: "Very well. There was a time
      when I loved Helen, or honestly thought I did, but I imagine we had both
      found out our mistake when I gave her up. It's certain that she would not
      have been satisfied with me. Our romance came to nothing and was done with
      long since; there's now no woman who could rouse the feeling I have for my
      wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up and leaned upon his chair, with his eyes fixed on Festing. "When
      I told you I was going to be married, you showed your confounded
      supercilious pity! You thought I was making a fatal mistake. Well, you're
      not a clever fellow, Stephen, but that was the worst blunder you ever
      made. Marrying Sadie is perhaps the only wise thing I have done. She has
      borne with my follies, hustled me when I needed it, and helped me to fight
      my weaknesses; and if there's any hope of my being a useful man, I owe it
      to her. Now it's obvious that I can't draw comparisons, but I think you
      see where this leads."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do see," said Festing, who felt somewhat moved. He had not heard
      Charnock talk like this before, and the note in his voice was significant.
      He smiled, to ease the strain, as he replied: "Comparisons would be
      particularly awkward just now, Bob. Besides, they're unnecessary, I'm
      convinced!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then there's no reason you shouldn't go home, and I've come to take you
      back."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing shook his head. "There are two reasons. In the first place, I've
      taken a contract."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That fellow, Dalton, would probably let you off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's uncertain, and I don't mean to ask. You don't seem to know that
      Dalton is Helen's brother."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock laughed. "Then I've no doubt he knows who I am; his manner ought
      to have given me a hint. The situation has a touch of ironical humor, and
      perhaps the strangest thing is that we should now be better friends than
      we have been yet. But what still prevents your going back?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Helen's money. I can't beg from her, after refusing the only thing she
      has asked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a bit of a fool," Charnock remarked with a grin. "I've begged from
      Sadie often and imagine she liked me for it; anyhow she expected it. But
      if you have made up your mind, I expect I can't persuade you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing's gesture indicated an unshaken resolve, and Charnock said: "Then
      I'm going to stop and see you through."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's ridiculous!" said Festing, who was strongly moved now. "You must
      think of Sadie. You can't stop; I won't allow it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock's eyes twinkled. "I expect Sadie will bear the separation. For
      one thing, we lost our crop and she'll save money while I'm away. She's
      not parsimonious, but she hates to waste dollars, and must have found me
      expensive now and then. Then I mean to earn something, and can imagine her
      surprise when I show her my wages check."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the surface, his mood was humorous, but Festing got a hint of something
      fine beneath. "But," he said, "you mustn't stay, and I'd sooner you didn't
      joke."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'll be serious; but after this there's no more to be said. Don't
      imagine it's altogether for your sake I'm going to stay. You know what I
      owe Sadie, and I want to show that her labor has not all been lost. in
      fact, I've got my opportunity and mean to seize it. Then if you feel some
      reparation is due to your wife, you can finish the work you made her drop.
      Help me to cut out liquor and stay with my job, and if you have trouble
      with your contract, I'll help all I can. Is it a bargain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a bargain," said Festing quietly. "Now I think we'll talk about
      something else."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat still for some time after Charnock left. His bitterness against his
      wife had gone, and it was plain that he had been a fool. For all that, he
      could not go home yet; the money was still an obstacle. Pride forbade his
      letting Helen support him. Moreover, he felt that to act against his
      convictions now would cost him her respect. There was perhaps no ground
      for supposing she felt much respect for him, but he meant to keep all she
      had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he got up and straightened the blankets in his bunk. The sooner he
      finished his contract, the sooner he could return, and there was much to
      be done next morning. The job had not begun well.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up at sunrise and spent several days repairing the damage the
      accident had caused, after which, for a time, things went smoothly. Then,
      one morning, he stood on a rocky ledge of the island, waiting while two of
      his men dragged an iron pulley backwards and forwards along a trolley
      wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning was clear and cold, and the snow had crept nearer the belt of
      dwindling pines that looked like matches tufted with moss. They grew in
      size as they rolled down the tremendous slopes, until they towered above
      the track in tall, dark spires. The mist had gone; rocks and trees and
      glistening summits were sharply cut, but the valley was rather marked by
      savage grandeur than beauty. There was something about its aspect that
      struck a warning note. It had a look of belonging to a half-finished
      world, into which man might only venture at his peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      The river had fallen and its turbid green had faded, for the frost had
      touched the glaciers that fed it on the heights, but the stream ran fast,
      swirling round the island and breaking into eddies. In one place, a white
      streak marked a rebound of the current from an obstacle below, and it was
      across this spot the men dragged the pulley. A chain and hook hung from
      the latter, and they were fishing for the skip that was lost when the log
      broke the rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing had spent the most part of the previous day trying different plans
      for grappling the skip, but the fast currents and smooth side of the big
      steel bucket had baffled him. His efforts had cost time and money, and he
      began to realize that he must give it up or try dangerous means. The chain
      stopped and tightened as the hook struck something below the surface, but
      next moment it moved on again, and when this had happened a number of
      times Festing raised his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can quit, boys," he said, and turned to a man close by. "She must
      have fallen with the shackles where the hook can't get hold, but I think
      she's only about three feet under water."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other studied the broken surface. The water was not transparent, but
      here and there a darker patch indicated a rock below. The eddies made a
      revolving slack along the bank, but near the skip joined the main current
      in its downstream rush.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've a notion there's a gully between her and us," he remarked. "Anyhow,
      we'll try to wade, if you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing threw off his jacket and plunged in. When he had gone a few feet
      he was up to his waist and it cost him an effort to keep his feet. After
      two or three more steps, the bottom fell away and, floundering savagely,
      he sank to his shoulders. Then his companion pulled him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The gully's there all right," the man remarked when they clambered out.
      "Say, that water's surely cold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be colder soon when the ice comes down, and if the skip's to be
      got out, we must get her now. I think I could reach her by swimming."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other looked doubtful, but Festing took off his heavy boots, and
      picking up the end of the rope they had used to move the pulley, walked to
      the edge of the island. He was now a short distance above the skip, and
      hoped the eddies would help him to reach the ledge it rested on before he
      was swept past; but he must avoid being drawn into the main stream, since
      there was not much chance of landing on the foam-swept rocks lower down.
      Making sure he had enough slack rope, he plunged in.
    </p>
    <p>
      An eddy swung him out-shore, towards the dangerous rush; the cold cramped
      his muscles and cut his breath, but he was already below the spot he had
      left, and there was no time to lose. The white streak that marked the skip
      seemed to forge up-stream to meet him, and he swam savagely until he was
      in the broken water and something struck his foot. Then he arched his back
      and dived, groping with his hands. He grasped the slippery side of the
      skip and felt the shackle loop. With some trouble he got the rope through,
      and then tried to put his feet on the bottom. They were swept away and he
      came up gasping, knowing he had made a mistake that might cost him dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held the end of the rope, but had been carried several yards
      down-stream, and the lost ground must be regained. The rope was rather a
      hindrance than a help, since the men on the bank could only haul him back
      to the skip and drag him under water, while he must pull the slack through
      the loop as he struggled to land. If he got out of the eddies he would be
      swept past the island, but he did not mean to let the rope go yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      A revolving eddy swung him in-shore, but the reflux caught and drove him a
      few yards lower down. The men were shouting, but he could not tell what
      they said. The roar of water bewildered him, and he fixed his eyes upon
      the rocks that slid past until a wave washed across his face. For a moment
      or two he saw nothing, and then was vaguely conscious that a trolley was
      running down the wire above. An indistinct object hung from the trolley
      and next moment fell away from it. A dark body splashed into the water,
      vanished, and came up close by. Then he was seized by the shoulder and
      driven towards the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men had stopped shouting and ran into the water at the island's lower
      end. Festing drifted towards them, but it looked as if he would be carried
      past. The drag of the rope kept him back, and his strength was going, but
      he braced himself for an effort and felt a helping push. Then somebody
      seized his hand, he was pulled forward, and felt bottom as he dropped his
      feet. In another few moments he staggered up the bank and gave the nearest
      man the end of the rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stick to that," he gasped, and turned to see who had helped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bob!" he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock dashed the water from his hair and face. "Thought you mightn't
      make it and jumped on a trolley they were loosing off. But we had better
      change our clothes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come to my shack," said Festing. "Signal them to send a trolley, boys."

      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      CHARNOCK TRIES HIS STRENGTH
    </h3>
    <p>
      The skip that crossed the river was loaded, and Charnock and Festing were
      forced to wait until it came back. They climbed to a platform on the
      bridge-pier and stood for some minutes, shivering in the wind. The skip
      would only carry one, and when it arrived Charnock made Festing get in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were in the water longest," he said. "Get aboard as quick as you
      can!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing was swung across the river, but waited until Charnock arrived,
      when they ran up the hill to the former's shack. The fire was out and
      Festing's face was blue, while Charnock's teeth chattered as he threw off
      his clothes. Festing gave him another suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid they're not very dry, but they're the best I've got," he said.
      "You did a plucky thing, Bob."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all, and you would, no doubt, have landed if I hadn't come. You
      see, the skip was starting and I didn't stop to think. But it's horribly
      cold. Where's your towel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He put on the half-dry clothes and went to the door. "I'm not often in
      such a hurry to get back to work, but if I don't move I'll freeze. See you
      later!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop a moment," Festing called. "Do you find the bunk-house comfortable?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not luxurious, but doesn't leak very much unless it rains unusually
      hard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why not come up here at night? I haven't another bunk or I'd have
      suggested it before, but a carload of ship-lap has arrived and I dare say
      Kerr will let me have a few boards."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks; I'd like that," said Charnock, who hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon afterwards Festing resumed his work. Kerr allowed him to take the
      boards, and when he had finished his supper Charnock came in. Sitting down
      by the fire, he filled his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's more room here and you can dry your clothes," he remarked,
      stretching out his legs to the blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're going to talk about what happened this morning," Festing replied.
      "I was getting exhausted when you jumped off the skip."
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all, I only gave you a push now and then. I was fresh, and imagine
      I swim better than you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's possible. I don't swim very well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why did you go into the rapid? I call it a blamed silly thing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I felt I had to recover the skip."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all," said Charnock, with a grin. "The skip could have stopped
      where it was. For a man who thinks much, you're ridiculously illogical;
      got no proper sense of relative values. Your business is to carry out your
      contract, and not risk your life for a rusty bucket."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You risked yours!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't. The only risk I ran was knocking your head off with my heavy
      boots. But if you hadn't begun the folly, I wouldn't have jumped, if the
      river had been full of the company's skips."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the door opened and the head contractor's engineer came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did a plucky thing to-day, Festing," he began; but Charnock
      interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't spoil my argument, Mr. Norton. I've been proving he made a fool of
      himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then there were two of you," Norton rejoined. "The trolley was running
      fast, and if you had dropped a few yards farther out, you wouldn't have
      got back." He turned to Festing. "I was rather mad about it when you broke
      the wire, and of course wanted the skip. Still I didn't mean you to take a
      risk like that. We could have fixed the thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A matter of bookkeeping?" Charnock suggested. "Much depends on how you
      charge up your costs, and one understands that doing it cleverly leads to
      promotion. The worst is when you come to the total&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll talk to you later. You're up against a big proposition, Festing; but
      if you find yourself in a tight place and I've a man or two to spare, or
      can help&mdash;-"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks; I may take advantage of your promise," Festing replied, and
      Norton turned to Charnock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are doing better than I expected when Dalton sent you along."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I imagine my recent activity would surprise my friends, and you're a
      stranger. However, I suppose I've got to keep it up so long as I work on
      the road."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's sure," said the other dryly. "Well, I didn't think it prudent to
      give you much at first, and now I'll mark you up an extra fifty cents."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped a few minutes, and when he went out Charnock laughed. "Not a
      bad sort, but I'm puzzled by my satisfaction at getting three dollars more
      a week. If I wanted a check not long since, I'd only to look penitent and
      go to Sadie."
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, they sat smoking quietly for a time, and then Charnock drew up
      his legs and frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter?" Festing asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing much," said Charnock. "I've got a bit of a weakness I don't think
      you know about. Neuralgic, I imagine; it grips me here." He indicated the
      region between his belt and chest. "Comes and goes when I'm not quite up
      to my proper form."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I expect jumping into the river and standing about in wet clothes
      brought it on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I have had it before. Besides, I've often been as wet; so have you.
      Anyhow, the pain's going, and there's a thing I forgot to mention. I met
      Wilkinson this afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing knitted his brows. "Wilkinson! What do you think has brought him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chance and Sadie's scheming. I've cause to suspect she forced him off his
      ranch, though she would probably wish she hadn't meddled if she knew she'd
      sent him here. As he looked surprised when he saw me, I imagine he'd no
      particular object in coming, except that he wanted a job."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you speak to him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not. It's very possible he'd have resented my remarks. Then I was
      on the company's business and the foreman was about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Festing thoughtfully, "it might be better to keep out of his
      way as far as you can. I don't know that he's likely to do us harm, but
      wish he had gone somewhere else."
    </p>
    <p>
      They let the matter drop and talked about other things until they went to
      bed. Next morning broke bracingly cold, but thin mist rolled among the
      pines a few hundred feet above the track. For the most part the climate of
      the interior of British Columbia is dry, and there are belts where
      artificial irrigation is employed, but some of the valleys form channels
      for the moist winds from the Pacific. Except in the bitter cold-snaps, it
      was seldom that the white peaks above the track were visible, and now
      something in the atmosphere threatened heavy rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock began his work as usual with the gravel gang. It was his business
      to spread the ballast thrown off the cars by the plow that traveled along
      the train, and although the labor was not exhausting it had tried his
      strength at first. His muscles, however, were hardening, and until the
      last few days, he had been able to scatter heavy shovelfuls of stones with
      a dexterous jerk that distributed them among the ties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Streaks of dingy haze that looked like steam rose from the river. The
      fresh smell of pines hung about the track, and the clash of shovels and
      ringing of hammers mingled harmoniously with the deep-toned roar of the
      rapids. The cold braced the muscles and stirred the blood, and the sounds
      of activity had an invigorating influence while the day was young, but
      Charnock felt slack. His pain had gone, but he was conscious of a nervous
      tension and knew what it meant. A small blister on his hand annoyed him,
      he growled at comrades who got in his way, and swore when the gravel fell
      in the wrong place. Somehow he could not get the stuff to go where it
      ought.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all that, he felt no serious inconvenience until about eleven o'clock,
      when a stinging pain spread across the front of his body. For a few
      moments he leaned on his shovel and gasped, but the pang moderated and he
      roused himself when the foreman looked his way. He must try to hold out
      for another hour, and he savagely attacked his pile of stones. When the
      echoes of the whistle filled the hollow he had some trouble in reaching
      the bunk-house, but felt better after dinner and a smoke, which he enjoyed
      sitting on a box by the stove; but the time for rest was short. The
      foreman drove him out, and feeling very sore and stiff, he resumed work.
    </p>
    <p>
      About four o'clock another pang shot through him and he dropped his shovel
      and sat down on a heap of ties, hoping to get a few minutes' rest before
      the gravel train came up. The pain was troublesome, but not dangerous. It
      might only bother him for a day or two, but it might last a week. Rest was
      the best cure, but sick men were not wanted at the camp. One must work or
      go, and when a cascade of gravel poured off the cars as the plow moved
      along he pulled himself together.
    </p>
    <p>
      It began to rain soon afterwards and he had left his slickers at the
      bunk-house, but he stuck to his work, while the sweat the effort caused
      him ran down his face, until the whistle blew. Then he went limply up the
      hill to Festing's shack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought I'd have supper with you, if you don't mind," he said. "Felt I
      couldn't stand for joining the boys. They've annoyed me all day and eat
      like hogs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing gave him a sharp glance. Bob did not often lose his temper, but he
      looked morose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I don't mind. Sit down."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock did so, and when Festing had filled his plate resumed: "This food
      is decently cooked, and I like my supper served and not thrown at me.
      Still, in view of what we're charged for board, it's annoying to think the
      contractor will be richer for a meal I haven't got."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a new thing to find you parsimonious. I hope you'll keep it up."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock's gloomy face softened. "I mean to. I'm thinking of Sadie's
      feelings when I come home with a wad of five-dollar bills. She won't be
      surprised; she'll get a shock."
    </p>
    <p>
      He talked with better humor during the meal, but was silent afterwards and
      sat with half-closed eyes, stretching out his feet towards the crackling
      logs. Although the pain had nearly gone, it would, no doubt, begin again
      in the morning, and he might have some trouble in hiding his weakness from
      the foreman. He could lay off for a day or two, but as his wages would
      stop and his board would be charged, it would cost him something. Besides,
      if he laid off once or twice, he would be told to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, however, did not account for his moodiness. He knew of no cure
      except rest, but it was easy to find relief; a small dose of spirit would
      banish the pain for a time. The remedy was dangerous, particularly to him,
      since it offered an excuse for repeated indulgence, and he struggled with
      the temptation. Liquor was difficult to get, because there was no
      settlement for some distance and the engineers had tried to cut off
      supplies, but it could be got. In fact, Charnock knew where he could buy
      as much whisky as he wanted, at something above its proper price. So far
      he had not done so, but continued self-denial would require a stern
      effort. A drink would banish the pain and enable him to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not known it fail since he drove over to Wilkinson's one afternoon,
      when he had been loading prairie hay since early morning and had forgotten
      his lunch. He reached the homestead scarcely able to sit upright on the
      driving seat, and a man asked him what was the matter. When Charnock told
      him he sent Wilkinson for whisky.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know all about it; the blamed thing grips me now and then if I work too
      hard and cut out a meal," he said. "I'll fix you up for the rest of the
      day, but won't answer for your feeling pert to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, Charnock had felt worse, but obtained relief by
      increasing the dose. Indeed, he had once or twice done so with unfortunate
      consequences; but after Sadie bought the farm and saw he led a regular
      life the pain had gone and had not returned until he went to work on the
      track. Now he was not going to give in, but did not want to talk, and was
      glad that Festing was occupied with some calculations and left him alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning he felt better and had two days' ease, after which the pain
      wrung him for the rest of the week. Somehow he stuck to his work, and his
      comrades, who were rudely sympathetic, helped him to elude the foreman's
      watchfulness. It was obvious that he could not keep it up, but the trouble
      often ended suddenly. Then an evening came when he could scarcely drag
      himself to the bunk-house for supper. It had rained all day and the
      building was overheated by a glowing stove and filled with the smell of
      rank tobacco and steaming clothes. Charnock could not eat the roughly
      served food, and for a time sat slack and limp, with the sweat upon his
      face, and his arms on the table. Then he got on his feet awkwardly and set
      off for Festing's shack.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain and cold revived him, but walking was difficult, and when he
      reached the shack he fell into a chair. Festing was not in, and Charnock
      remembered he had said something about having extra work to do. It was
      dark, but the log fire threw out a red light, and by and by Charnock,
      glancing round as the shadows receded, thought there was something unusual
      on the table. It looked like a bottle, but they kept no liquor in the
      shack. Festing was abstemious but Charnock suspected that he had practised
      some self-denial for his sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited until a blaze sprung up, and then his relaxed pose stiffened. It
      was a bottle of whisky, better stuff than the railroaders generally drank,
      for he knew the label. Moreover, when the light touched the glass the
      yellow reflection showed that it was full. He got up and approached the
      table, wondering how the liquor came there, until he saw some writing on
      the label. Picking up the bottle, he read his own name.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put it down abruptly and stood with his hand clenched. The veins
      swelled on his forehead and the pain nearly left him as he fought with
      temptation. It was some weeks since he had tasted liquor, but this was not
      all. A drink would give him relief from the gnawing ache and perhaps a
      night's sound sleep. If he could get that, he might be well for most of
      the next day. But he shrank from the remedy. There was liquor enough to
      last some days, but the next bottle would not last as long, and he knew
      there would be another. He must resist and conquer his craving now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door and picked up the bottle by the neck. With a swing of
      his arm he could throw it among the pines; he wanted to hear it smash.
      Victory could be won by a quick movement; but afterwards? The touch of the
      glass and the way the yellow liquid gleamed in the light fired his blood.
      If he was to win an enduring victory, he must fight to a finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the bottle in the light, he moved his chair and sat down close by,
      after which he looked at his watch. He would give himself half an hour. If
      he could hold out now, he need not be afraid again, because the odds
      against him would never be so heavy. The craving was reenforced by pain
      and bodily fatigue; his jangled nerves demanded a stimulant. Yet to win
      would make the next conflict easier, and he had resources that he tried to
      marshal against the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rough work on the track had given him confidence. He had always had
      physical courage and muscular strength, and it was something to feel he
      could hold his own with his comrades at a strenuous task. Moreover, his
      saving Festing from the river had restored his self-respect. But he had
      stronger allies, and his face got hot as he thought of the two women who
      had fought for him when he had scarcely tried to help himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie had given up her ambitions and was content to live at the lonely
      farm because she thought it best for him. He remembered the bitter
      disappointments he had brought her and how he had found her sitting,
      depressed and tired, at his neglected work when he came home from some
      fresh extravagance. Sometimes she had met him with the anger he deserved,
      but as a rule she had shown a patience that troubled him now. Then there
      was Helen, who had borne slander and estrangement from her husband for his
      sake. Both had made costly sacrifices, of which he was unworthy; but it
      was unthinkable that the sacrifices should be made in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was his imagination, or the proximity of relief, but the
      physical torment he suffered got worse. He could not sit straight, and
      leaned forward, with head bent and hands grasping the sides of his chair,
      until he looked at his watch. Ten minutes had gone, but he must hold out
      for twenty minutes more. Fumbling awkwardly in his pocket, he got his
      tobacco pouch. He did not want to smoke, but could occupy some time by
      filling his pipe, and did so with slow deliberation. Then he let the match
      go out as an idea dawned on him. The bottle had been put there with an
      object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson hated Sadie. He had struck at her and injured Helen, but had
      plotted a harder blow. The plot had, however, miscarried, for Charnock
      almost forgot his pain in his fury. The fellow was a dangerous reptile,
      and could not be allowed to hurt Sadie by his poisonous tricks. Charnock
      meant to punish him, but must first overcome the insidious ally the other
      had counted on. He looked at his watch again. A quarter of an hour had
      gone; he felt stronger, and more confident. For all that, the fight was
      stern, and at length Festing, entering quietly, was surprised to find
      Charnock sitting with his watch in his hand. His brows were knit; his face
      looked pinched and damp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you doing, Bob?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trying my strength," said Charnock, who got up. "Three minutes yet to go,
      but I think we can take it that I've won."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand. Is this a joke?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I look as if I'm joking?" Charnock rejoined, with a forced smile.
      "Anyhow, I'd like you to notice that I'm perfectly sober and this bottle
      has not been opened, although I've sat opposite it for nearly half an
      hour. I'd have finished the half-hour if you had not come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing picked up the bottle and read the writing. "Who brought the thing
      here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suspect Wilkinson. He knows a drink would stop the pain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Festing quietly. "I think I understand! You have made a good
      fight, Bob, and I believe you've won. But we'll take precautions; it will
      be some satisfaction to throw out the stuff."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the door, but Charnock stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold on! I mean to keep the satisfaction to myself. Give me the cursed
      thing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing put the bottle in his hand, and opening the door Charnock swung it
      round his head and let it go. There was a crash as it struck a tree, and
      he went back to his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's done with! It's remarkable, but I don't feel as sore as I did.
      Perhaps the effort of resisting was a counter-irritant. However, we have
      said enough about it. Tell me how you got on with the job that kept you
      late."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      FESTING'S NEW PARTNER
    </h3>
    <p>
      Charnock felt better next morning and luck favored him. An accident to the
      gravel train disorganized the work, and he and some others were dismissed
      for the afternoon. He went to Festing's shack, and making himself
      comfortable by the fire, opened a tattered book and enjoyed several hours
      of luxurious idleness. After his exertions in the rain and mud, it was
      delightful to bask in warmth and comfort and rest his aching limbs. The
      next day was Sunday and he lounged about the shack, sometimes reading and
      sometimes bantering his comrade. The pain had gone and he felt cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he returned to work on Monday he was sent with a bag of bolts to the
      bridge, and presently reached a spot where the heavy rain had washed away
      the track. For about a dozen yards the terrace cut in the hillside had
      slipped down, leaving a narrow shelf against the bank. The shelf broke off
      near the middle, where a gully had opened in the hill. Water flowed
      through the gap, and in order to get across one must pick a way carefully
      over the steep, wet slope. This, however, would save a toilsome climb, and
      Charnock, jerking the bag higher on his shoulders, went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later he saw Wilkinson come round a corner. One of them
      would have to go back to let the other pass, and it would be difficult to
      turn if they met at the gully. Charnock did not mean to give way, and with
      his arms crooked to support his load, he required some room. There was no
      way up the torn bank, and on the other side a nearly perpendicular slope
      of wet soil and gravel ran down to the river. In places, the surface was
      broken by small, half-buried firs.
    </p>
    <p>
      When both were near the gully Wilkinson stopped, and Charnock, whose head
      was bent, thought he had not known who he was. He certainly looked
      surprised, and Charnock was conscious of rather grim amusement as he
      guessed the reason. Wilkinson had, no doubt, not expected him to be
      capable of carrying a heavy bag along the dangerous ledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo!" he said. "The boys told me you were crippled by your pains."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was. The pain's gone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rest's a good cure," said Wilkinson. "You got laid off on Saturday,
      didn't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The curiosity that had made Charnock stop was satisfied. Since Wilkinson's
      work kept him at some distance from the gravel gang, it looked as if he
      had made inquiries about Charnock, and had probably been surprised to
      learn he had started with the others. There was, however, no use in taxing
      the fellow with trying to make him drunk, because he would deny that he
      knew anything about the whisky or declare that he had sent it with a
      friendly object.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he said, "but I didn't need the cure as badly as you think.
      However, I'm not in a talkative mood and this bag is heavy. I'll trouble
      you to get out of the way."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson looked hard at him. Charnock knew why he had sent the whisky and
      meant to quarrel, but was shrewd enough to choose his ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can dump your bag and wait until I get past."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all," said Charnock. "I don't see why I should pick up the load
      again to convenience you. Anyhow, I'm going on, and the thing takes up
      some room."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson measured the distance across the gap. He imagined he could reach
      the other side first and squeeze against the bank, when Charnock must take
      the outside and would probably fall. He did not mean to be forced back,
      particularly as there were men at work not far off who had, no doubt,
      noted Charnock's aggressive attitude. The latter, however, was quicker
      than he thought, and reached the dangerous spot before Wilkinson got
      across. Splashing, and slipping in the mud, he advanced recklessly, and
      Wilkinson could not turn back. Moreover, he could not strike Charnock,
      because he was in the workmen's view, and the railroaders would not
      approve his attacking an apparently defenseless man. He thought Charnock
      knew this, but the fellow was not as defenseless as he looked. The heavy
      bag gave him a certain stability and momentum.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you come any farther before I find a hold, we'll both go down," he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It looks like that," Charnock agreed. "I don't mean to stop."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson clutched at the slippery bank but the wet gravel tore out. It
      was impossible to get up, and if he tried to scramble down, he might not
      stop until he fell into the river. He glanced at Charnock's set face and
      got something of a shock. He had thought the fellow meant to bluff and
      would give way if he were resolutely met; Charnock was impulsive, but
      never stayed with a thing. Now, however, he looked dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Driving his boots into the mud, Wilkinson braced himself, with one foot so
      placed that it might trip his antagonist. Then he set his lips as he met
      the shock. Charnock struck him with his shoulder and forced him backwards
      by the weight of the bag. The mud slipped under his feet; he staggered and
      clawed at the bank, but his fingers found no hold. They plowed through the
      miry gravel, and falling face downwards, he rolled down the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock lurched across the gully and stopped when he reached the shelf.
      Wilkinson had swung round on his descent and his head was lowest. He was
      sliding down rather slower, and there were some trees not far off.
      Charnock did not care if he brought up among them or not, and watched with
      a curious dispassionate interest. The fellow looked ridiculous as he went
      down, scattering the gravel with his hands. He was in some danger, but
      this was his affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson rolled against the thin branches of a half-buried tree, which
      caught and turned him partly round. The branches broke and he went down
      sideways, until he and a wave of loosened gravel struck another tree. This
      stopped him, and Charnock plodded on until he was off the shelf.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better go down and fetch him, boys," he shouted to the other men. "I
      reckon he's not much the worse, except in temper, and you'll find a rope a
      piece back up the track."
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw them start and then resumed his journey. Whether he was hurt or
      not, Wilkinson could talk, for he was pouring out scurrilous epithets.
      Charnock laughed as he stamped through the mud. His antagonist had got the
      worst of it, and there was a satisfactory explanation of their quarrel.
      They had met on a narrow path and neither would give way, but as Charnock
      was carrying the load he had put the other in the wrong. Wilkinson could
      not revenge himself by circulating the story he had told before because it
      would interest nobody at the camp, and Charnock's friendship with Festing
      would prove it untrue. In fact, he imagined Wilkinson would think it
      prudent to leave him alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He delivered the bag, and going back stopped at a spot where Festing and
      some others were fitting the end of a heavy beam into a pole. Charnock
      watched while the men dragged out the beam and then replaced it after
      deepening the hole. They were splashed and dirty, and presently Festing
      leaned upon his shovel while he got his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem determined to fix it properly," Charnock remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing nodded. "There's no use in piling rock about half-bedded frames.
      It would mean trouble if they gave way under a freight train."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You look ahead. The first difficulty is that if the frames don't hold up,
      you won't get paid. The engineers are responsible after the regular
      traffic starts, and I've no doubt they test a contractor's work. You would
      save something in wages if you built a pile-driver to sink those posts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't the men or time. If I don't get this part of the work done
      before the frost comes, it's going to cost me more. It would mean using
      powder and making fires to thaw out the ground."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock agreed and went on. He had been long enough over his errand and
      the foreman's tongue was sharp, but he mused about Festing as he picked
      his way across the pools between the ties. Festing's object was to make
      money, and he imagined, perhaps foolishly, that he had urgent ground for
      doing so, but he meant to make a good job. He felt his responsibility, and
      apart from this took a curious delight in doing things well. In fact,
      Festing's thoroughness was rather fine; he was an artist in his way. The
      artist's methods, however, were not as a rule profitable when applied to
      contract work. Then Charnock's meditations were rudely disturbed, for he
      heard a shout and saw the foreman had noted his cautious advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Watch him coming, boys!" the latter remarked. "Like a blamed cat that's
      scared of wetting its pretty feet! Say, do you want a private car to move
      you along the track? Jump now and load up that trolley, you soft-bodied
      slob!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock obeyed, promptly and silently. He had, at first, responded to
      encouragement of this kind by a witty retort, but had found the
      consequences unfortunate. There was no use in wasting delicate satire on a
      dolt. Besides, it was a relief to feel he was getting better and was able
      to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon, he had occasion to pass the spot where Festing was
      occupied, and stopped to watch. The men were getting a big log on end; two
      steadying it and supporting part of the weight by a tackle fixed to its
      top, while Festing and another guided its foot into a hole. The ground was
      wet and slippery and their task looked almost beyond their strength, but
      Charnock knew he would get into trouble if he were seen going to their
      help. Since he was not in view of the foreman where he stood on top of the
      bank, it was prudent to remain there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The log swayed as its point caught a stone, and Festing's hands slipped on
      the muddy bank. He shouted to the men at the tackle, who bent their backs
      and hauled, but the timber did not rise as it ought. Charnock, looking
      round, noted that the stake the tackle was fastened to was pulling out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get from under! She's coming down on top of you!" he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing looked up and saw the danger; but if the log fell it would not
      stop until it and the tackle plunged into the rapid below.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay with it!" he gasped; and he and his companions braced themselves
      against the crushing weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The veins rose on his forehead. His back was arched and his wet slickers
      split, but it was plain to Charnock that the men could not hold up the
      timber, which would injure them if it fell. But with help they might
      perhaps move it enough for the point to sink into the hole before the
      tackle gave way, and Charnock leaped recklessly from the top of the bank.
      He knew what he was undertaking when he took hold. Festing would not let
      go; he meant to put the log into its socket, or let it start on its plunge
      to the river over his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few tense moments they struggled savagely, with slipping hands and
      labored breath, while Festing, using his head as a ram, pushed the point
      of the swaying mass nearer the hole. Then, when all could do no more, the
      strain suddenly slackened and there was a jar as the log, sliding through
      their arms, sank into the pit. After this, it was easier to hold it, while
      one threw in and beat down the gravel. Five minutes later, Charnock sat
      down on the bank. His face was crimson, his hands bled, and his chest
      heaved as he fought for breath, but he felt ridiculously satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks!" gasped Festing. "Lucky you came along. I thought she was going!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blamed silly thing not to let her go," Charnock replied. "Some day your
      confounded obstinacy will ruin you. Anyhow, we've put her in. Not bad for
      a cripple!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he sucked his torn fingers, and fearing that he might have to account
      for the delay, went about his business. It was curious that the tense
      exertion had not brought on the pain, but his back and shoulders were sore
      when he went to Festing's shack in the evening. The small, earth-floored
      room was dry and warm, and smelt pleasantly of resinous wood. They did not
      light the lamp, for although it was dark the red glow of the fire
      flickered about the walls. Charnock felt a comforting sensation of bodily
      ease as he lounged in his chair, and when he had smoked a pipe told
      Festing about his encounter with Wilkinson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I imagine the brute isn't hurt much, but don't know if I'm glad or not,"
      he said. "He looked remarkably funny as he slid down the bank, with his
      arms and legs spread out like a frog. Suppose I should have thought about
      the risk of his tobogganing into the river, but I didn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I expect he deserves all he got, and remember the satisfaction it
      gave me to throw him out of the poolroom. Looks as if we were primitive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're all primitive in this country," Charnock rejoined. "They have no
      use for philosophical refinement in Canada. Their objects are plain and
      practical and they employ simple means. We're not bothered by the
      conventions that handicap you at home. If a man hurts you, and you're big
      enough, you knock him out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have both knocked out Wilkinson, but I'm not sure that we have done
      with him. The simple plan's not always as easy as it looks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think he can make much trouble. If he does, one of us will knock
      him out again. As it will hurt us less than it hurts him, he'll probably
      get tired first."
    </p>
    <p>
      They let the matter drop, and Festing presently remarked: "The rain makes
      things difficult, but it's lucky the frost keeps off. I must try to get
      the frames up at the awkward places before it begins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You haven't enough men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could use more. Still, one couldn't engage men to come here on short
      notices, and if we get a long cold-snap I might have trouble to keep them
      employed. I could, of course, use a number of men and teams hauling out
      logs across the snow, but the heavier stuff won't be needed for some time,
      and I can't lock up my money. The small man's trouble is generally to
      finance his undertaking."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock looked thoughtful. "Yes; that's where the pinch comes. You can't
      work economically unless you have capital. Sadie's a good business woman,
      and she often said that if you want to save dollars, you must spend some."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much depends on how you spend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so," said Charnock, smiling. "Betting against marked cards doesn't
      pay, but I've stopped that kind of thing. However, I think I could get you
      the money you need."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing looked hard at him. "You have none."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sadie has a pile. She'd give me enough with pleasure if she thought it
      would help towards my reform. But if you take the dollars, you've got to
      take me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Festing. "But why do you want to join?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To begin with, I'm getting avaricious and want to go home with my wallet
      full. Then I'm tired of my job. I suppose it's a foreman's privilege to
      insult his gang, but the brute we've got is about the limit. He's
      truculent but not very big, and some day, if I stop on, I'll pitch the hog
      into the river. Then I'll certainly get fired, and there'll be an end to
      my dreams of wealth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing was silent for a few moments. He understood Charnock better now,
      and knew that when he was serious he often used a careless tone. Bob
      wanted to help him as much as he wanted to help himself, and he saw no
      reason to reject his plan. He must, however, be warned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you join me, you run some risk of losing your money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. It's obvious that you don't think the risk very big, and I'm
      willing to take a fighting chance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know how big it is. That depends on the weather and accidents."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly," said Charnock. "If I join you with some money and teams, will
      it lessen, or add to, the risk?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will lessen the risk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will it reduce, or increase, your working costs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think the answer's obvious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it looks as if you'd be foolish to turn my offer down."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing got up and walked about irresolutely for a moment or two. Then he
      stopped with some color in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I called you a shirker, Bob, and ordered Helen to leave you alone. Now I
      see you're the better man and I'm a confounded, fault-finding prig. But
      you're not vindictive, and we'll let that go. The trouble is, I'm
      obstinate and sure of what I can do&mdash;at least, I was, though my
      confidence has got shaken recently. Well, I think I can finish this
      contract, but don't know. I've lost a good deal of money, and would hate
      to feel I might lose yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the line you took with Helen," Charnock rejoined. "I'm not
      surprised that she was vexed, and since we're being frank, you're a little
      too proud of yourself yet. Anyhow, I like a plunge; it's exhilarating, and
      there's not much excitement in betting on a certainty." He paused and
      resumed with a twinkle: "Besides, if there is a loss, Sadie will stand for
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing gave him a puzzled look, and he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't understand yet? You're dull, Stephen. Now I'm not a greedy
      fellow, and my chief use for dollars is to spend them. I want to take back
      some money to show Sadie I've made good, and if we put this contract over
      she'll be satisfied and you'll have her gratitude. That's why I mean to
      make a job if I join you, and I imagine you're with me there. Well,
      perhaps I've said enough. Is it a bargain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Festing quietly, and they shook hands.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      CHARNOCK MAKES PROGRESS
    </h3>
    <p>
      Deep snow covered the hillside and the pines, with lower branches bent,
      rose in somber spires against the dazzling background. The river had
      shrunk and the dark water rolled in angry turmoil between ice-glazed
      rocks. Streaks of gray haze rose a foot or two into the nipping air, and
      the clash of shovels had a new, harsh ring. It was nearly dinner time, and
      Festing noted that his men had not done much since breakfast as he walked
      down the beaten hollow in the middle of the track. One could not tell how
      long the cold-snap would last, but it had already embarrassed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped above an excavation where Charnock and another were cutting a
      hole in the frozen gravel. The former held a steel bar in blue,
      frost-cracked hands and twisted it in the cavity while his companion
      struck the end. He knelt, in a cramped pose, in the snow, and Festing
      smiled. Bob was fond of comfort, and it was strange to see him occupied
      like this. Then, noting the length of the bar, he thought they would not
      sink the hole deep enough for the blasting charge before dinner, which was
      unfortunate, because the powder fumes are poisonous and would hang about
      the spot for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later the whistle blew, but Charnock and his companion did
      not stop, and Festing heard the thud of the hammer as he went on. This
      rather puzzled him. The work was hard and he had not expected Charnock's
      assistant to continue his task longer than he need. Festing was
      fastidiously just, and thought it shabby to steal a workman's time;
      moreover, he imagined that if he had asked the fellow to go on after the
      whistle blew he would have refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiosity led him to wait farther along the track until the thud of the
      hammer stopped. It looked as if Charnock was putting in the dynamite, and
      Festing hoped he would be careful with the detonator. By and by he heard a
      warning shout, and a moment or two afterwards saw a blaze of light. Then
      there was a curious sharp report, and pieces of broken rock splashed into
      the river. The gorge rang with echoes and a mass of gravel roared down the
      slope. It was obviously a good shot and had moved more spoil than Festing
      expected. A glance at his watch showed that the others had given up a
      quarter of an hour of their short noon rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing set off again, and in the meantime, Charnock, holding his breath
      as he stood on the snowy bank, looked down into the hole the explosion had
      made.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think we've made a first-class job," he said, stepping back out of
      reach of the fumes. "I like the company's taste in powder."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's better than ours," his companion agreed with a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much better. The company is richer than us. It would have saved us some
      hard work if you had hooked a few more sticks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're a mean crowd," said the other. "Blamed suspicious how they tally
      out their stores, but I'll see what I can do. I'd sooner use good powder
      than cut frozen gravel with the pick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The pick's no tool for white men. We won't use it unless we're forced,"
      Charnock answered, and both laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the shack, and while they were at dinner Festing asked: "How
      did you persuade Jim Brown to stop until you fired the shot?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't persuade him. I took it for granted he would stop."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's a good man, but sometimes sulky if one wants him to do what he
      thinks is outside his job. I don't imagine I'd have found him so obliging
      if I'd asked him to keep on."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock laughed. "Perhaps not; our methods are different. You would have
      explained logically why the thing ought to be finished; but that's a
      mistake. There are not so many logical people as you think. Instead of
      arguing, I made a silly joke."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You certainly get on with the boys," said Festing thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're a careless, irresponsible crowd. I'm irresponsible, too, and they
      understand me. They trust you, but you sometimes puzzle them. Perhaps that
      accounts for the thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing talked about something else until they went back to work. Next
      morning he climbed the hill to a level bench where some of his men were
      busy hauling logs to the top of the skids. It was easier to move the big
      trunks across the snow, and he had seized the opportunity to get some out,
      but was surprised when he saw the number ready to be sent down. While he
      examined them, Charnock, sprinkled with dusty snow, came up, leading a
      heavy Percheron team. They dragged a log into place, and then Charnock
      unhooked the chain and beat his hands. His skin-coat was ragged and his
      fur-cap battered, but he looked alert and virile as he stood by the
      steaming horses' heads. The gray trunks of the pines made a good
      background for his tall figure, which had an almost statuesque grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You look very well, Bob," Festing remarked. "It's obvious that the pain
      has gone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It won't come back while the dry weather lasts; I don't know about
      afterwards. These are pretty good logs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was wondering how you were able to bring up so many."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're here; that's the main thing. You can look after other matters and
      leave this to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you don't mind, I'd like to see how you did it," Festing replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well! You're a persistent fellow; I suppose you had better come
      along."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing went with him and stopped where a gang of men were at work among
      the fallen trees. Two, swaying backwards and forward with rhythmic
      precision, dragged a big crosscut-saw through a massive trunk. Others
      swung bright axes, and the wood rang with the noise of their activity. All
      were usefully employed, but there were more of them than Festing expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The two boys with the cantpoles belong to the contractor's bridge-gang,"
      he said. "What are they doing here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I told you Norton said I could have them when we were moving the
      big poles," Charnock replied. "He saw I needed help."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that was some days since. He sent them to help at a particular job
      which you have finished."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He hasn't asked me to send them back. Looks as if he'd forgotten them.
      Anyhow, they're useful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have no right to keep the men. How did you get them to stop?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was easy," said Charnock. "The cooking at the bunk-house isn't very
      good, and I told our man to find out what they liked. In fact, I said we'd
      stand for it if he put up a better hash."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing laughed. The plan was characteristic of Bob's methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must send them back," he said, and went away, doubting if Bob would
      do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all that, he admitted that Charnock was doing well. He stuck to his
      work, and had a talent for handling men. Nobody was at all afraid of him;
      but his sympathetic forbearance with his helpers' weaknesses and his
      whimsical humor seemed to pay much better than bullying. He made a joke
      where Festing frowned, but the latter felt thoughtful as he went
      down-hill. One must make allowance, but Bob was something of a
      responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week later, he got a jar as he stood with Charnock beside a part of the
      track they had laboriously underpinned. The ballast train was coming down,
      filling the valley with its roar, and the beaten snow heaved among the
      ties as the big cars rolled by. The rails sank beneath the wheels and then
      sprang up until the load on the next axle pressed them down again; the
      snow flaked off the side of the road-bed, which was built up with broken
      rock. Festing thought the movement was too marked and waited for the
      locomotive, which was coupled to the back of the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engine was of the ponderous, mountain type, but it ran smoothly, with
      steam cut off, and although the ground trembled and the rails groaned as
      it passed, there was no threatening disturbance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The bank's holding up, and this was about the worst spot," Charnock
      remarked. "We had some trouble in bedding the king posts in the slippery
      stuff."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Kerr gave them a nod as he went by. "Looks pretty good, and they have
      a full load on the cars."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think we'll wait until the train comes back," Festing said to Charnock.
      "The engineer will open the throttle wide to pull her up the grade."
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat down in a hollow of the bank, for a bitter wind blew through the
      gorge, and after a time the roar of falling gravel echoed among the pines.
      Then there was a heavy snorting and the locomotive came round a curve,
      rocking and belching out black smoke. The cars banged and rattled, slowing
      with jarred couplings and rolling on when the driving wheels gripped.
      Festing waited anxiously, because the wheels of a locomotive when driven
      hard strikes what is called a hammer blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by the ground began to throb; the vibration got sharper, and
      Festing watched the track as the engine passed. Cinders rattled about him,
      there was a mist of snow, but he saw the cross-ties start and the rails
      spring up and down. Then the clanging cars sped past, and when they had
      gone he climbed down the side of the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now bare of snow and one could see the stones. Two or three had
      fallen, and the edges of the others were a little out of line. The
      unevenness was marked, and although one or two of the heads of the timbers
      had moved, the movement might not have caught Festing's eye had he not
      known the treacherous nature of their support. He did not think anybody
      else would notice that they were not quite in their proper place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid we're up against trouble, Bob," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock looked unusually thoughtful. "The engineer had to start from a
      dead stop and turn on full steam. That made the jarring worse, but it
      wouldn't happen with the ordinary traffic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps not," Festing agreed. "Still, you see, the frequent repetition of
      a smaller shock&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock stopped him. "It's those confounded posts! If we pull them out,
      we'll have to cut down to the rock to find a solid bed, and there's a mass
      of stone to move. What would the job cost?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He said nothing for a minute after Festing told him, and then remarked:
      "It's Kerr's business to find fault, and he looked satisfied."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He doesn't know as much about it as we do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I wish we knew less. How long do you think the track would stand if
      we left it alone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Until we got paid," said Festing. "It might stand for some time
      afterwards."
    </p>
    <p>
      He fixed his eyes on Charnock and waited. Bob had expressed some
      praiseworthy sentiments about making a good job, but this was a different
      thing from living up to them when it would cost him much. What they ought
      to do was plain, but Festing admitted that the sacrifice required an
      effort. Then, somewhat to his surprise, Charnock looked up with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're not sure of me yet, Stephen, and I don't know that you can be
      blamed. It's a nasty knock, but we have got to bear it. Stop there a few
      minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To bring Kerr back and show him the damage. He'll have to lay off the
      gravel gang while we pull down the bank."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing waited. Bob would stand by him, but he felt anxious. It would be
      an expensive business to rebuild the track and the frost would make things
      worse. In fact, if they had any more trouble of the kind, they might be
      ruined. Then he got up as he saw Kerr coming along the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an hour or two the rails were up and they began to pull down the
      rockwork that faced the bank. The ragged stones cut their numbed hands,
      their backs ached with lifting heavy weights, and they stumbled under the
      loads they carried up the snowy incline. They had, however, help enough,
      for Charnock went away for a time and came back with three or four men
      from the construction gang. Festing noted that although he made them
      useful, he did not give them the hardest work. He refrained from asking
      how Charnock got the men, but was not surprised when the foreman arrived
      and inquired in forcible language what they were doing there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me answer him," said Charnock. "I feel in the mood. It's my first
      chance of letting myself go; as long as you're working for wages the
      advantage is with the boss. Besides, I think I ought to do something for
      the boys, who can't talk back."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing admitted that he talked very well. Charnock had a keen eye for the
      ridiculous and a pretty wit, and was no longer handicapped by the fear of
      being dismissed. While the foreman replied with coarse but rather
      meaningless abuse, Charnock's retorts had a definite aim and hit their
      mark. He indicated with humorous skill the defects in his antagonist's
      looks and character, and Festing's gang laughed uproariously, while the
      borrowed workmen applauded as loudly as they durst. At length, the
      foreman, breathless and red in face, gave up the unequal contest and
      returned to his first question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you came for an argument, you've got it, and I can go on for some time
      yet," Charnock replied. "However, if you really want to know why the boys
      are helping me, you can ask Mr. Norton at the bridge."
    </p>
    <p>
      The foreman retired, muttering, but not towards the bridge, and Festing
      looked hard at Charnock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was anxious for a moment," Charnock admitted. "But I didn't think he'd
      go. For one thing, I knew he knows Norton doesn't like him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'll leave you to deal with Norton if he hears about the matter. Now
      you have had your amusement, we had better get on."
    </p>
    <p>
      The short rest and laughter had refreshed the gang and they made good
      progress. As the holes between the frames deepened, the work got harder
      and the footing bad, because they were forced to stand on slippery ledges
      while they passed the heavy stones from man to man. Charnock was ready
      with jocular sympathy if one fell or a stone bruised somebody's hand, and
      his jokes spurred on the weary. It got dark soon in the hollow, but as the
      light faded the flame of a powerful blast-lamp sprang up and threw out a
      dazzling glare. The lamp belonged to the company, and Festing did not ask
      Charnock how he had got it. Bob had his own methods, and it was better to
      leave him alone. When the whistle blew, the latter turned to the borrowed
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go to our shack, boys, and get supper there. I told the cook to fix up
      something extra, and dare say you'll find it better hash than yours. I'd
      like you to come back to-morrow, but am afraid it's risky."

      CHAPTER XXIV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE CHINOOK WIND
    </h3>
    <p>
      The frost got more rigorous, drying the snow to a dusty powder in which
      Festing's lumber gang floundered awkwardly. Had there been a thaw, the
      surface would have hardened, but now they were forced to move the logs
      through loose, billowy drifts. The men sank to their knees, it was
      difficult to find a fulcrum for the handspikes, and the logs would not run
      well on the beaten roads. The latter broke into holes, and the dry snow
      retarded the smooth sliding of the lumber like dust. One could not touch a
      saw or ax-head with the naked hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing had seen that he might be embarrassed by hard frost, but had not
      expected it to continue. On the central tablelands of British Columbia
      winter is severe, but near the coast and in valleys open to the West the
      mitigating warmth of the Pacific is often felt. He had imagined that when
      his work upon the track was hindered the snow would help him to bring down
      lumber ready for use when a thaw set in. Now, however, wages were mounting
      up and little work was being done. He began to wonder what would happen if
      a change did not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning he knelt in a hole below the track, holding a drill. He wore
      mittens, but the back of one was split and showed a raw bruise on his
      skin. It needs practise to hit the end of a drill squarely, and Charnock,
      who swung the big hammer, had missed. The worst was that the bruise would
      not heal while the temperature kept low. They were sinking a hole through
      frozen gravel that was worse to cut than rock, because the drill jambed in
      the crevices and would not turn. But for the frost, they need not have
      used the tool; a hole for the post they meant to put in could have been
      made with a shovel, without using expensive powder.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he thought they had gone deep enough Festing got up and looked about.
      White peaks glittered against a vivid blue sky. The pines sparkled with
      frost and the snow in their shadow was a soft gray. The river looked as
      black as ink, except where it foamed among the rocks, and the gorge echoed
      with the crash of drifting ice that shocked and splintered on the ledges.
      The light was strong, and rocks and trees far up the slopes stood out,
      harshly distinct. As he turned to the West, however, he noted a faint
      haziness and shading off in the outline of the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know if that softness means anything, and hardly believe it
      does," he said. "When I made up the wages book last night and saw what the
      work we have been able to do has cost us, I got a shock. The boys are a
      pretty good crowd, and if we pay them off we won't get them back; but it's
      obvious we can't go on long like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock nodded. "How much money have we left?"
    </p>
    <p>
      When Festing told him he looked thoughtful. "I didn't know things were
      quite as bad! Well, I suppose I could get another cheque, but don't want
      to put too much strain on Sadie's generosity. She might imagine I'd got on
      a jag! There are drawbacks to having a character like mine; it's easier
      lived up to than got rid of. However, what do you suggest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll hold on while the money lasts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The plan's simple, as far as it goes. It's remarkable how short a time
      money does last and how hard it is to earn. Sadie misled me about that;
      she used to hint that I had only to apply my talents and pick up the cash;
      but since she's a business woman, she ought to have known better. The
      virtuous path is about as rocky as luck can make it; but perhaps you take
      something for granted if you allow that making money is virtuous."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing frowned impatiently. "One ought to pay one's debts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One's generally forced," Charnock replied. "But I think I see what you
      mean. We undertook this contract and must carry it out if possible. Sadie
      would agree. She's like her father, and the old man often said: 'It's safe
      to deal with Keller's. When you put up the money, we put up the goods.'
      But let's get the powder."
    </p>
    <p>
      Opening a box, he took out a stick of yellow material that looked rather
      like a thick candle. A big copper cap was squeezed into one end, and from
      the cap there trailed a length of black fuse. Festing put the stick into
      the hole and cautiously filled this up with frozen soil, leaving a short
      piece of fuse sticking out. While he was feeling for his matches Kerr
      arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are making trouble for me," the latter began. "You did the square
      thing in pulling out the weak frames, but they're not replaced, and I
      can't run the gravel train across the spot. As the back track is nearly
      ballasted up, I don't know how I'm going to use the locomotive and cars."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The frost is stopping us," said Festing. "It is not our fault."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so, but my chiefs at headquarters don't want to know whose fault
      it is. Their method, as you ought to know, is statistical&mdash;we're
      given a number of men and tools, and the value of the work done must equal
      the expense. It's the only standard for judging an engineer. His business
      is to overcome the difficulties, and if he's unable he's obviously of no
      use."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock grinned. "Employers' logic! Piffle of that kind only goes when
      there are more engineers than jobs. I imagine there'll be a change some
      day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry Dalton's gone back," Kerr resumed. "He's a friend of yours, and
      would have seen what we're all up against. But there's another thing; the
      boys are beginning to kick. We have had to lay off the ballast gang for a
      day now and then, and they claim they're not getting a square deal. One
      fellow told me we oughtn't to have given the contract to a man without
      capital to carry him over a set-back. He said if you'd had money you could
      have hired extra labor and kept to schedule, and in the end it wouldn't
      have cost you more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The argument is sound," Festing agreed. "In fact, it shows more
      understanding than I'd expect the boys to use."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kerr looked hard at him. "I suspect that somebody is stirring them up. You
      see, they haven't demanded more wages yet; they only claim that I ought to
      hustle you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fellow's object isn't very plain, but I've no doubt the demand for
      bigger pay will come. Well, we can't hire more help, and if there's no
      change soon, the frost will break us without your bothering. We'll do our
      best until then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll leave it at that," said Kerr, with a sympathetic nod; and when he
      went away Charnock turned to Festing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wilkinson's the man, and as the boys have a real grievance he'll find
      them easy to work on. That means I've got to write to Sadie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Festing. "If you write, I stop. Your wife has sent you money
      enough, and I'm afraid some of it is lost. We must trust to luck, and in
      the meantime we'll fire the shot."
    </p>
    <p>
      He blew a whistle and then striking a match lighted the fuse and hurried
      away. A minute or two later, lumps of frozen gravel flew about the track
      and showers of smaller fragments scattered the snow. As Festing came out
      of his shelter a man with an angry look advanced along the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you warn folks before you shoot off your rocks?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My partner whistled," Charnock answered. "What's the matter, anyhow? Did
      the shot jar your nerves?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A rock a foot across mighty near jarred my head! A smaller piece got me
      plumb on the ribs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing thought this unlikely, in view of the fellow's distance from the
      explosion, but could not be certain he was not struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry if you got hurt," he said. "You ought to have heard the
      whistle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyhow, I didn't. You want to stop shooting rocks when there are men
      around. Then you've mussed up the track and can't put her straight. Why
      don't you hire more boys and rush the job? Can't see why the bosses let
      two deadbeats like you and your partner have the contract!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have got it. How we mean to carry it out is our business, not yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it's certainly our business if we work or not," the other rejoined.
      "As the bosses will find out if they reckon we're going to lose our time
      to help you save your dollars!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He went away grumbling, and Charnock looked at Festing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was that bluff? Do you think he means it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. They haven't lost much time through our fault, but the
      frost has interfered with other jobs, and I expect there'll be trouble if
      it lasts. I'm puzzled, because they're not a bad-tempered lot, and I
      understand that Wilkinson is not a favorite. Your throwing him down the
      bank wouldn't strengthen his influence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's easy to work on men's feelings when they're discontented," Charnock
      replied. "The worst is that Kerr can't stand by us if the gang put down
      their tools. Labor's scarce in the mountains, and he'll be forced to do
      what they want."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing gloomily agreed. "I'm afraid so. However, we must do the best we
      can in the time we have left."
    </p>
    <p>
      They worked by a blast-lamp until late at night and began again before
      daybreak in the morning. The weakened frame had been replaced, but others
      needed strengthening and the rockwork must be built up among the timbers.
      The stones required careful fitting, and it was impossible to dress them
      to rough shape. The frozen surface resisted the tool and they broke if
      much force was used. Fires were made, but the rock thawed irregularly and
      much time was lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing's bruised hand gave him trouble, his mittens wore to rags, and his
      numbed fingers cracked and bled, but he worked savagely until evening.
      Then he walked stiffly to the shack and sat, dejected and aching, looking
      at the food on the table. Although he had eaten little all day, it cost
      him something of an effort to begin his meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour afterward he heard steps and voices outside and opened the door.
      The light shone out from behind him and he saw a group of dark figures in
      the snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, boys," he asked, "what do you want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We want to know when you're going to fix the track," one replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's easily answered. We mean to put it right as soon as we can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not good enough!" remarked another. "We've got to know when."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'm sorry I can't tell you. It depends on the weather."
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of them growled, and Festing felt Charnock's hand close warningly on
      his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't you come into the light, boys?" the latter asked. "I'd like to know
      to whom I'm talking."
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not move, and Charnock resumed: "Have you brought your foreman or
      Wilkinson?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody said neither had come, and Charnock nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I reckon they know what's best for them! Wilkinson doesn't like me,
      but he's not looking for more trouble; I imagine he's had enough. Then the
      foreman's not a friend of mine, but he has a better job than yours and
      means to hold it down. If you get up against the bosses, he's not going to
      be fired."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence, and he saw his remarks had not been wasted. He had
      hinted that the men were being used and given them ground to distrust
      their leaders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I half expected another fellow, a friend of Wilkinson's, who claimed he
      had been hit by a stone. Has he come along?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Said he was too sore and would have to lay off to-morrow," one replied.
      "That's another thing. When you shoot off your blasts you have got to
      watch out that nobody gets hurt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure," agreed Charnock. "We did watch out and blew the whistle; but we
      want to do the square thing. If Pearson got hurt and can't work, let him
      show you the bruise. We'll stand for his pay until you think he's fit to
      begin again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's fair," admitted the other with a laugh. "He wasn't showing the
      bruise much. Say, you're pretty smart!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so," said Charnock, modestly. "Looks as if I needed all the
      smartness I've got. We're up against the weather and a big awkward job,
      and then you come along and worry us! However, what are you going to do
      about it if we can't put the rails down as soon as you want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll make the bosses break your contract."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock pondered, keeping his hand on Festing's arm, because he thought
      he could handle the matter better than his comrade. Festing was too blunt
      and sometimes got angry. He saw that the men were determined, but while
      they had, no doubt, been worked upon, he thought they had no personal
      grudge against him or his partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's only one way you could put the screw to the bosses, and that
      way's dangerous. The <i>Colonist</i> states that they have a number of men
      unemployed in the coast towns. If Kerr wrote to a labor agent, he'd send
      him up a crowd."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would cost him high to bring the men here, and take some time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is so," Charnock agreed. He saw the others had made their plans and
      calculated the pressure they could put upon the engineers. Time was
      important, and he thought the foreman had helped them to estimate the
      expense the company would incur by the delay before they could get new
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Putting down your tools would cost you something," he resumed. "How long
      do you imagine it would take to persuade Kerr?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess a week would fix him; he wouldn't stand for a fortnight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well! I don't suppose your object is to put us off the road; you
      want what you're entitled to. So do we all, and though it's often
      troublesome to get, there's no use in taking the hardest way. If you stop,
      you lose a fortnight's wages and somebody will get fired. Not now, of
      course, but afterwards; the bosses know their job. Well, give us ten days,
      and the time you miss won't run to many dollars. If we can't put the rails
      down then, we'll quit."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a moment, and then somebody said, "We'll let it go
      at that. It's a deal!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The others growled consent and Charnock waited until they moved away,
      after which he shut the door and sat down wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You took the right line," Festing said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hesitated about fixing the time, but we can't go on much longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Festing. "Well, we have ten days!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They said nothing more and soon afterwards went to bed. Next morning there
      was a marked haziness in the west, but the frost was keener. It looked as
      if they must be beaten, although they meant to fight until defeat was
      sure, and Festing was surprised when he glanced at his comrade. This was
      not the careless lounger he had known. Charnock's face was grim and
      somewhat pinched; his hands were torn and bruised. He picked the heaviest
      stones to lift and was the first to take hold of ponderous beams. Festing
      owned that he had misjudged Charnock, but not more than he had misjudged
      himself. His farming had been a rash experiment and the contract a
      reckless gamble; the one threatened to end as badly as the other. Then Bob
      had somehow kept his wife's love, and he, with senseless obstinacy, had
      estranged Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts were depressing, but they drove him on. Hope was dead; he had
      made a horrible mess of things. All that was left was to take his
      punishment and hold on until he was knocked out, but he meant to do this.
      He did not stop for dinner with the rest, but occupied himself with
      something that needed doing, and forgot that he had gone without the meal.
      Afterwards a pain began in his left side, but he had other aches, and the
      extra discomfort did not trouble him much. In the afternoon he worked with
      a kind of sudden fury, and when at length the tired men dropped their
      tools found some difficulty in straightening his back. He had never used
      his muscles as he had done for the past few days, but the strain would
      soon be over.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was unusually dark when he went up the hill to the shack. The pines
      rose in blurred masses from the shadowy snow and he could not see the
      hollow of the path. Supper was a melancholy meal, but he ate because he
      was hungry, and afterwards dragged his chair to the fire. There was a
      great pile of crackling logs and the blaze flickered about the room, but
      bitter draughts came in beneath the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An open fire's of no use; I thought about getting a stove," he said, and
      paused with a dreary smile. "It's lucky I didn't send the order!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may need it yet," Charnock replied. "Somehow we'll put the rails down
      in time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing did not answer and picked up a newspaper. He did not want to read,
      but could not sleep, although he was very tired, and felt he must have
      some relief from his anxious thoughts. The newspaper was a <i>Colonist</i>
      that had left Victoria some days before, and he read it methodically from
      the first column, trying to fix his attention on things that had happened
      in remote mining settlements and market reports. His efforts were
      mechanical, but he long afterwards remembered what he read and how he
      dully followed the arguments in an article on political reform. Indeed,
      when he saw the <i>Colonist</i> his imagination carried him back to the
      log-walled hut, and he felt something of the dazed hopelessness that
      blunted his senses then.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Charnock, half asleep, lounged with his legs stretched
      out to the fire. The logs snapped and a fitful wind stirred the tops of
      the pines. Now and then some snow fell from a branch and a loose roofing
      shingle rattled, but by degrees the sounds died away. Everything was
      strangely quiet, except for the roar of the river, which had got more
      distinct. Charnock shivered and felt a puzzling tension. It was often calm
      at night, particularly in hard frost, but he felt as if something was
      going to happen. Looking up, he saw Festing nod with his eyes half shut,
      and felt for his tobacco.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he cut the plug, the silence was broken. There was a humming in the
      pine tops and light branches began to toss. The draught from the door got
      stronger, but did not bite as keenly, and it sounded as if the snow was
      falling from the trees. Then some slipped down the roof, and getting up
      with tingling nerves, he opened the door. All the trees were rustling and
      waves of sound came up the valley. The sound swelled, the air felt damp,
      and a drop of moisture from the roof splashed upon his head. He drew a
      deep breath of relief, for a warm wind from the Pacific was roaring
      through the defile. Then Festing dropped the newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why have you opened the door?" he asked drowsily, and got up with a jerk
      as the draught swept the smoke about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A Chinook!" he exclaimed, and ran to the door. "We'll have rain and
      warmth while it blows."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's great!" said Charnock hoarsely. "We are through the worst!" Then he
      caught Festing's arm and laughed. "Say something wise, partner; I want to
      shout and dance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better go to bed. It will be thawing hard to-morrow, and there's
      much to be done. A Chinook doesn't last long in the mountains."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This Chinook is going to last until we put the rails down," Charnock
      replied.

      CHAPTER XXV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE THAW
    </h3>
    <p>
      When Festing went out at daybreak the air was soft, and drops from the wet
      pines fell into the honeycombed snow. The surface was turning to slush,
      but he knew it would wear down into a slippery mass on which the logs
      would run. This was fortunate, because he doubted if labor could be
      usefully employed upon the stones just yet. For a few moments he pondered
      the matter and listened to the river's turmoil. The deep, booming note was
      sharper, water splashed noisily in the gullies, and there was a ringing
      crash as an ice-floe broke upon a rock. Then he turned as Charnock came
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which is it&mdash;logs or stones?" the latter asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Logs, I think; we can handle them easily," Festing replied. "The other
      job is urgent, but the thaw has only begun, and when the ground gets
      properly soft we'll do twice as much as we could now. Still, there's a
      risk. We could make some progress with the track, and the warm spell
      mayn't last."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take the risk," said Charnock with a laugh. "There's not much fun in
      playing for safety, and you don't get far that way, while when you try to
      foresee things you generally see them wrong. But let's be practical! As
      soon as the ground is soft enough we'll ask leave to hire half the gravel
      gang. That will make friends of the opposition and won't put up our wages
      bill. If you double your helpers, you halve the working hours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Obviously. But you have to pay the larger number all at once. Where's the
      money coming from?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "From the head contractor. We'll try to make Norton sign for an interim
      payment. Let's go and see him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing was doubtful, but they found Norton, the contractor's engineer,
      more compliant than he hoped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you are entitled to ask for a sum on account, but I'd take some
      responsibility in allowing the demand," he said. "Why did you come to me
      now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We want to be just," Charnock answered modestly. "At present, there's no
      prospect of our finishing the work we ask the money for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It doesn't go much beyond a prospect yet," Norton rejoined. "However,
      I'll help you if I can, and will see what Kerr thinks. He's the man we
      have both to satisfy in the end."
    </p>
    <p>
      They went to work up the hill in the melting snow, and soon their clothes
      were dripping and their long boots soaked. At first, the logs vanished in
      the drifts through which they tried to roll them, and the horses slipped
      and floundered in the slush, but this flowed away and left a harder layer
      that was presently beaten firm. The surface turned black and compressed
      into ice, and before long rows of heavy logs plunged down the skids. Every
      moment must be turned to good account, and Festing stopped and went down
      reluctantly when Kerr sent for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've seen Norton and he thinks we ought to help you out," Kerr remarked.
      "Though he argues from single instances, his judgment's often good, and he
      seems convinced you can be trusted because you saved a skip of his. Of
      course, I had my opinion; but as he represents the contractor you are
      working for, I couldn't urge him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks!" said Festing. "I wish I'd brought Charnock; he'd deal with this
      better."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kerr laughed. "Your partner has some talents and seems to have made Norton
      and my storekeepers his friends. If he hadn't, there might have been
      trouble about certain irregularities. However, you can have the gravel
      gang if I'm forced to lay the boys off, and as soon as we can run the
      train over the repaired track you'll get your cheque."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing went away, feeling satisfied, but not without some anxiety. He
      could not urge Norton to go farther than his employer would approve, and
      the payment agreed upon was small. Besides, if the frost returned before
      he had made the track secure, he would have spent enough money in extra
      wages to prevent his going on, and should this happen it might be
      difficult to obtain payment for other work already completed. He would be
      at the mercy of Norton's employer, who might contend that by throwing up
      his contract he had forfeited his claim. It was obvious that he must make
      the utmost use of every hour of open weather, and for the rest of the day
      he worked with a stubborn energy that conquered fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time, the logs went screaming and grinding down the skids, but
      darkness made launching them dangerous, and they could not light the
      lumber road on the hill. They worked in the dark, rolling out the sawn
      trunks from among the brush and melting snow until there was room to hook
      on the team. Then the driver, walking by his horses' heads, felt with his
      feet for the hollowed track, and losing it now and then embedded his load
      in snow. Then he called for help, and men with cantpoles laboriously hove
      the ponderous mass back to the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work was worse on the inclines, where the logs ran smoothly and there
      was a risk of their overtaking the horses. Rain had begun to fall and one
      could not see the obstacles, but there were pitches where one must go fast
      in order to keep in front of the dangerous loads. But risks must be run in
      lumbering, and Festing felt that rashness was justified. Speed was the
      thing that counted most.
    </p>
    <p>
      When supper time drew near, men and horses were worn out, and Festing knew
      that if he urged the former to continue he could not do much without the
      teams. There were, however, a few logs he meant to haul to the skidway
      before he stopped, and he had some misgivings when he started with the
      last. It was an unusually large trunk, and the tired horses floundered as
      they tightened the chain. Thawing snow when beaten hard is as slippery as
      ice, but the animals kept their feet and the mass began to move. Festing
      got a firm grip on the near horse's bridle and plodded forward cautiously,
      with the rain in his face when he crossed the openings in the wood. The
      snow reflected a puzzling glimmer, but the darkness was thick among the
      trees, and drops from the shaking branches fell into his eyes. Turning his
      hat-brim down, he felt for the edge of the trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by he stopped at the top of a descent. The gray snow looked all the
      same, and the hollow track vanished a few yards in front; the rows of
      trunks had faded into a vague dark mass, and the branches met overhead in
      a thick canopy. The horses were big, valuable Percherons, but they were
      exhausted and stood slackly, with steam rising from their foam-flecked
      coats. Festing did not like the look of the dip, and knew the trees grew
      close upon the track at the bottom, but he must go down, and shouted to
      the hesitating animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      They moved faster; the log grinding heavily across the snow behind. Then
      the strain on the chain slackened, and he dragged at the bridle as he
      began to run. The log could not be stopped now; it was moving faster than
      he had thought, and all that he could do was to keep the team in front.
      His feet slipped on the icy trail, and the horses floundered, but they
      knew the danger and broke into a clumsy trot. It was hard to keep up, but
      Festing must hold them to the track and steer them round a bend ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The log lurched noisily across lumps and hollows, the chain made a harsh
      clank, and the wood echoed the thud of heavy hoofs. Festing ran his best,
      and imagined that he was running for the horses' lives and perhaps for
      his. He durst not look round, and could only guess where the log was by
      the noise. The blurred trees rolled back to him in a thick dark mass, but
      he thought the gap he followed got narrower ahead. This was, no doubt, the
      awkward spot where the trunks closed on the track, and there was a corner.
      He must go on and trust to luck for getting round.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments he was almost at the corner, and although it was hard to
      see, thought he distinguished a break in the dark wall of trees. One must
      keep to the inside, on the right; but there was very little room, and if
      he miscalculated, he or the horses would collide with a trunk. He smashed
      through a bush that caught his foot, but his hold upon the bridle saved
      him from a fall. It looked as if he had left the track and was plunging
      into the wood. Then a black trunk became detached from the rest,
      apparently straight in front. He did not mean to let go, although he might
      be crushed between the horse's shoulder and the tree, and drew as close as
      possible to the animal. Something brushed his coat, he felt a button torn
      off, but the tree was passed. He knew where he was now, and thrusting hard
      against the horse urged the animal towards the other side of the road. The
      log ran into soft snow and slowed; there was more room here and the
      steepest pitch was behind. A few minutes later, he reached the top of the
      skids and sat down on the log, breathing fast and feeling badly shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      He frowned as he thought there was no physical reason he should feel
      shaken. He was used to strenuous effort, and danger could not be avoided
      when one engaged in construction work. It was mental strain that was
      wearing him out; the constant endeavor to finish a task in less than the
      necessary time. Want of money was, however, the main cause of his
      difficulties, and when he had got his cheque it would be possible to take
      things easier. Comforting himself with this reflection, he got up and led
      the horses down-hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clang of hammers and rattle of shovels rose from the gorge, sharply
      distinct at times, but melting when the throb of the river swelled and a
      gust roared among the trees. A dark skeleton of steel that stood out
      against pulsating flame, with blurred reflections below, marked the
      central pier of the bridge; the line of track was picked out by twinkling
      fires. Then the scream of a whistle pierced the sound and the lights went
      out. The men were going back to the bunk-house and Festing envied them.
      Their work was finished for the day and they could rest, free from care,
      until the whistle roused them to begin again. Many were, no doubt, tired,
      but that was man's common lot, and muscular fatigue in moderation was no
      hardship. The strain came when one had to make the dollars go round and
      see that every effort paid its cost. Among the mountains, the cost was
      high.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock joined him when he was grooming the horses in the rude stable,
      because the teams must be cared for before the men thought of food. Supper
      was ready when they went in, and when they had eaten they sat by the
      hearth, drying their damp clothes and enjoying the warmth. They had
      scarcely spoken to one another during the day; as a rule, it was only
      after supper one could indulge in talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Charnock took his pipe from his mouth. "It's luxuriously warm,
      but one can't expect the Chinook to last. I imagine we'll have some use
      for a stove after all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're not out of danger yet," Festing replied. "Norton's cheque has still
      to be earned, but I begin to feel hopeful. If we can hold out for a few
      more days, I think we'll turn the corner. Anyhow, the plan you made
      prevents any trouble from Wilkinson for a time. Do you think he has had
      enough and will leave us alone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't tell, but it doesn't matter much. We mustn't exaggerate the
      fellow's importance; he's a very poor sample of the theatrical villain.
      Besides, I imagine you seldom meet the latter in real life; it's an
      unnecessary part."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean we're up against enough without a plotting antagonist? Well, I
      must agree. Considering the weather&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock stopped him with a smile. "I don't mean the weather, though one
      can't leave that out. In a new country, man must make the best fight he
      can against Nature; but she's not his worst enemy. It's our passions, our
      virtues sometimes, that lead us into a coil. Looks as if they didn't want
      much help from outside."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That kind of speculation's not much in my line."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so. You're what you call practical, and your mind runs upon the
      number of yards of rockwork you can put up in a day or the logs you can
      cut. Very useful, but it doesn't take you far enough. In fact, if you had
      thought more about other matters, you wouldn't be here now. Nor would I."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not sure I see your drift," said Festing impatiently. "What's your
      explanation for our being here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock's eyes twinkled. "If you want the truth, it's because you're
      something of an obstinate ass. Wilkinson had really nothing to do with it,
      and the weather hasn't much. Your pride brought you and keeps you. You
      took the wrong line with Helen, and then, knowing you were wrong, couldn't
      force yourself to accept her help. However, I'll admit that we are a pair
      of fools. I could have spent a lazy winter at the homestead if I'd liked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You came to look for me," Festing remarked with feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did, but stayed to please myself. Thought I'd show Sadie what I could
      do; felt virtuous about it at the time, but begin to suspect that vanity
      pushed me on. Sadie would, no doubt, sooner have me safe at home. Anyhow,
      I think I've proved my argument&mdash;we're here, doing unthinkable
      things, freezing, sweating, getting thin, because of our own stupidity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a way, that is so," Festing agreed. "Still, I can't go back until I
      have finished this job."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you had better not," said Charnock dryly. "I imagine you wouldn't
      be easy to live with it you felt you had come home because you had failed.
      You might make good resolutions, but the thing would spoil your temper all
      the same. The pinch comes when you try to carry good resolutions out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing got up and threw fresh wood on the fire. "If you have finished
      philosophizing, we'll talk about something else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not going to talk about logs and wages," Charnock replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. You haven't told me much about Wilkinson. He seems a clever
      rascal. Do you think we have ground for being afraid of him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't imagine he'd run much risk or make a sacrifice for the sake of
      getting his revenge; that kind of thing isn't often done by normal people.
      All the same, he doesn't like us, and if he found he could do us an injury
      without much trouble, I dare say he'd seize the chance. On the whole, it
      might be prudent to watch him. Now we'll let the matter go."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing nodded, and they lounged in silence by the snapping fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning they got to work upon the track, and on the following
      afternoon, when the thaw had gone far enough into the ground, Charnock
      went for the gravel gang. The men came willingly, although Wilkinson and
      the foreman did not appear, and with the connivance of one Charnock
      obtained several of the company's blast-lamps. They worked well, and when
      they went away Festing was satisfied with what they had done. He imagined
      that Kerr and Norton had put themselves to some inconvenience in order to
      let him have the gang, and for the next two or three days he redoubled his
      efforts. The strain was getting unbearable, but the thaw would not last,
      and he must finish all the work the frost would delay while he could get
      the men. When he dismissed his helpers, they parted on friendly terms; but
      his look was grave that evening when he made up his accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wages had been a heavy drain, and he could not meet his storekeeper's
      bills unless he got his cheque. The defective underpinning had, however,
      been replaced or strengthened, and he expected that Kerr would test it
      soon. If the work did not pass the test, he would be ruined, and would,
      moreover, have involved Charnock in a serious loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about the middle of the morning when he stood with Kerr and his
      partner beside the mended tract. Bright sunshine touched the hillside,
      leaving the gorge in shadow, and the air was clear and cold. The snow had
      gone for a few hundred feet above the rails; the pines stood out sharply
      from the dark background, and the hollows in the glittering slopes beyond
      were marked by lines of soft-blue shade. Festing thought a change was
      coming, and he had not finished the track too soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by a plume of smoke rose above the trees and something twinkled in
      an opening. A rhythmic snorting and a rumble pierced the throb of the
      river, and Kerr looked up the track.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The engineer's bringing her along fast. Shall I flag him to snub her and
      shut the throttle before he runs across the new stuff?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Festing quietly. "It won't be needful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The work hasn't had much time to settle, and a locomotive using steam
      hits the rails harder than when she's running loose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We don't want our money until it's earned, and you'll have to haul heavy
      loads up the grade when the regular traffic begins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the meantime, I'm not thinking about the rest, but about the gravel
      train."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The track will stand," said Festing, in a steady voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train came on; the long, low-sided cars rocking and banging down the
      incline. Small figures jolted up and down on the gravel, and at the far
      end the big plow flashed in the sun. The front of the engine got larger,
      and Festing fixed his eyes upon the rockwork he had built among the piles.
      All that could be done had been done; he had not spared money or labor,
      for Charnock had agreed that the job must stand. It was, no doubt,
      exaggerated sentiment, for he was highly strung, but he felt that he had
      staked his wife's respect and his future happiness on his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ground shook, and flying fragments of ballast beat upon his
      turned-down hat; there was a deafening roar as the cars jolted past, and
      he saw the rails spring. Then the wind that buffeted him changed to
      eddying puffs, the noise receded, and he lifted his bent head. The
      rockwork stood firm, the ends of the timbers had not moved, and only a few
      small heaps of gravel had fallen from the road-bed. Festing felt that he
      was trembling, and Kerr put his hand on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a good job; I'm quite satisfied. If you'll come along to Norton's
      office, I'll tell him he can give you an order on headquarters for your
      cheque."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll come instead," said Charnock, who turned to Festing. "Go to the
      shack and take a smoke. If you come out before I return, I'll stop the
      gang."
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later he found Festing sitting slackly by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The order is in the mail-bag and will go out on the first train," he
      said. "It's lucky we got it, because we have cut things very fine. I had a
      note some days since from the fellow who sends us our stores, insisting on
      our settling his bill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why didn't you tell me?" Festing asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock laughed. "I imagined you had enough to bother you, and his
      account is big. We couldn't have paid him without going broke, and wages
      have first claim. There was a way out, but you had given me strict orders
      not to write to Sadie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't have allowed that, but you're a good sort, Bob!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Charnock cheerfully, "it was, so to speak, touch and go; but
      we have turned the awkward corner, and I think are going to make good."

      CHAPTER XXVI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A NEW UNDERTAKING
    </h3>
    <p>
      Soon after the rails were laid down the frost returned, and one cold
      morning Festing sat in his shack, studying a letter from Helen. Norton's
      cheque had helped him to overcome the worst of his difficulties, things
      were going better, and Charnock would superintend the workmen until he was
      ready to go out. Festing felt that he need not hurry, and wanted to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen had written to him before, without any hint of resentment, and he
      had told her what he was doing. She knew Bob was his partner, and no doubt
      understood what this implied. It was obvious that he had been wrong in
      disliking Bob and half suspecting him; besides Helen knew from the
      beginning that he had not suspected her, although he had insisted that she
      had been imprudent. This ground for difference had vanished, but he
      wondered what she thought, and could not gather much from her letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wrote with apparent good-humor and stated that all was going
      satisfactorily at the farm, where, indeed, nothing of importance could be
      done until spring. For all that, there was some reserve. A personal
      explanation was needed before they could get back to their old relations
      of intimate confidence, and he was ready to own his mistakes.
      Unfortunately, the explanation must be put off, because there was one
      point on which he was still determined, although his resolve no longer
      altogether sprang from pride. He must, if possible, repair his damaged
      fortunes before he went home. Farming on a proper scale was expensive
      work, and Helen's capital was not large. In order to raise a big crop, one
      must speculate boldly, and he meant to do so with his own money.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw a danger in staying away too long, but his contract was only
      beginning to be profitable. Besides, one thing led to another, and a
      number of extras, for which the pay was good, had been added to the
      original plans. Then he had been asked to undertake another job and had
      arranged to go over the ground with Kerr and Norton that morning. In a
      way, he would sooner have left it alone, because it would keep him longer
      from home, but the terms offered a strong inducement to stop. Glancing at
      his watch, he saw it was nearly time to meet the engineers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found them and Charnock near the half-finished bridge, which crossed
      the river obliquely. The track approached its end in a curve and then
      stopped where a noisy steam-digger was at work. Between the machine and
      the bridge, the hillside fell in a very steep slope to the water, which
      rolled in angry turmoil past its foot, and the channel dividing the bank
      from the island that supported the central bridge-pier was deep. Here and
      there a slab of rock projected from the slope, but, for the most part, the
      latter consisted of small stones and soil. The surface was now frozen
      beneath a thin crust of snow and the pines were white.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know roughly what we want," said Kerr. "If you'll come along, you can
      look at the shot-holes we made to test the ground. Then I'll show you a
      car-load of the rock we want to use, but it's largely a lumber job and
      that's why we thought of offering it you. You have some good choppers
      besides the teams and plant required."
    </p>
    <p>
      They climbed about the bank by dangerous paths, and then stopped at the
      end of the bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The thing can be done, but it will only make a temporary job," Festing
      remarked. "You will have to do it again, properly, in a year or two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That the Company's business," Kerr replied. "As soon as we start the
      traffic improvements can be paid for out of revenue instead of piling up
      construction costs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can imagine the cost if we cut back the hill far enough to ease the
      curve and lay the track on solid ground," Norton interposed. "The
      half-measure of scooping out a shallow road-bed and dumping the stuff on
      the incline is ruled out, because the spoil wouldn't lie and the river
      would sweep the dirt away. If we filled up the channel with rock, we'd
      turn the current on the bridge-pier."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Charnock said something and Festing let them talk while he looked
      about. Since a temporary job was required, he thought the plan was perhaps
      the best that could be used. It called for a timber framework, beginning
      about half-way up the bank, although its height would vary with the
      ground. The gaps between the frames would be faced with rockwork and then
      filled with rubble in order to make a bed for the rails on top.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you will come to the office, I'll show you the detailed drawings,"
      Norton said presently, and the others followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the office Festing studied the drawings, and then giving
      them to Charnock, lighted his pipe. He wanted to undertake the contract,
      but hesitated. The work already on his hands would occupy him for some
      time, and a lengthy absence might prejudice him with Helen. Besides, he
      had taken risks enough and a new venture might prove a rash challenge to
      fortune; one could not foresee all the difficulties that might arise. But,
      if he succeeded, he would go home with the means to resume his farming on
      a profitable scale. Then he saw Charnock looking at him and knew he would
      agree to his decision. Festing put down his pipe and knitted his brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" said Charnock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing got up with a quick, resolute movement, and turned to Norton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll undertake the job."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all right," said Norton. "I'll get the papers drawn up and send
      them over for you to sign."
    </p>
    <p>
      They went out, and as they climbed the hill Charnock remarked: "This may
      turn out a big thing, partner. Are you going home before we start?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing looked up sharply, with a disturbed air. "No. To begin with, I've
      got to be about because the thing is big."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, as matters are going smoothly now, I'll leave you for a week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can manage for a week and one of us must stay. But why d'you want to
      leave?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the whole, I think one of us had better go," Charnock answered with
      some dryness. "If you don't mind, I'll get off to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      He started next morning, in the caboose of a returning supply train, and
      Festing, who went to see him off, stood for a few minutes on the snowy
      track while the rattle of wheels and snorting of the locomotive died away.
      Bob had made a curious remark when he talked about going, and Festing
      wondered what he meant, but dismissed the matter and went back to his
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bitter afternoon when Charnock got down at the little prairie
      station that was marked by a water-tank, the agent's shack, and the lower
      frames of three unfinished grain elevators. He hired a rig at the livery
      stable, and borrowing a fur-robe started on his drive across the plain.
      The landscape was empty and featureless except for the gray smears of
      distant bluffs. Nothing moved on the white expanse, and there was no sound
      but the measured thud of the horses' feet; the air was still and keen with
      frost. When the cluster of wooden houses sank behind a gradual rise, the
      wavy, blue riband of the trail was the only sign of human activity in the
      frozen wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The snowfall, however, is generally light on the Western plains, and the
      trail was good. Its smooth surface was dusty rather than slippery and the
      team went fast. Everything was different from the varied grandeur of the
      mountains; the eye found no point to rest upon, and the level snow
      emphasized the loneliness. In spite of the thick driving-robe, the cold
      bit through Charnock's worn-out clothes, but he was conscious of a strange
      and almost poignant satisfaction. This was not because he was at heart
      still something of a sybarite and had borne many hardships on the
      railroad; he was going home and in an hour or two Sadie would welcome him.
      It was curious, but when he married Sadie he had not thought she could
      inspire him with the feeling he had now. But he had learned her value and
      understood something of what she had done for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it got dark he urged the horses and tried to control his impatience.
      Later he felt his heart beat as he drove round the corner of a shadowy
      bluff and saw his home-lights twinkle across the snow. A hired man came
      out to take the team, he got down, nearly too numbed to move, and as he
      stumbled up the steps Sadie met him with a cry of delight. She drew him in
      and when he stood, half-dazed by the brightness and change of temperature,
      in the well-warmed room, she took her arm from round his neck and moved
      back a pace or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock's skin-coat was ragged, his mittens were tattered, and his long
      boots badly worn. He looked tired and unkempt, but Sadie's eyes were soft
      as she studied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your face is very thin, but I don't like it less," she said. "You haven't
      come back the same, Bob; I think you have grown."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps the pains account for the thinness," Charnock answered with a
      smile. "Anyway, you ought to be satisfied, because you tried to make me
      grow, and in a sense I was very small when I left you. But we won't be
      sentimental and I want to change my clothes."
    </p>
    <p>
      He found fresh clothes ready, and when he came back his slippers, pipe,
      and a recent newspaper occupied their usual place. Sitting down with a
      smile of content, he lazily looked about.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is remarkably nice," he said. "The curious thing is that I feel as
      if I'd only left the house five minutes since. Everything I want is
      waiting, although you didn't know I was coming."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew you would come some day, and come like this, without letting me
      know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so you kept everything ready?" Charnock rejoined. "Well, I imagine
      that's significant! But you see, I didn't know I could leave camp until
      the day before I started, and then it looked as if I'd get here as soon as
      the mail."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie gave him a quick glance. "Then something happened that made you
      leave?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something did happen, but nothing bad. However, it's a long story and
      I've not had much to eat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Supper will be ready in five minutes, and I've got something that you
      like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Charnock, "I suppose that means you kept the thing I like
      ready, too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked about matters of no importance until the meal was over, and
      then Sadie made him sit down by the stove and light his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," she said, "you can tell me all you did at the construction camp,
      and leave nothing out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock was frank. He knew Sadie understood him, perhaps better than he
      understood himself, and if his narrative gave her any pleasure, he thought
      she deserved it. Moreover, when he wanted he talked rather well, making
      his meaning clear without saying too much. When he finished she gave him a
      level glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're surely a bigger man, Bob! I see that, not only by what you have
      done but by what you think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Charnock, twinkling, "I'm glad you're satisfied, but you'll
      probably find out that there's room for improvement yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you must joke," Sadie rejoined with mild reproof. "But what
      about Festing? Doesn't he meant to come back until the job's finished?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So far as I could gather, he does not. I tried tactfully to persuade him
      he was acting like a fool and imagine he sees a glimmer of the truth. All
      the same, he's obstinate."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie was silent for a minute, knitting her brows, and then looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have only three days; I suppose I mustn't keep you after that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It mightn't be prudent. If I stay longer, I shall, no doubt, feel unequal
      to going back at all. My industrious fit's very recent and good
      resolutions fail."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pshaw!" said Sadie. "Try to be serious. I must see Helen to-morrow and
      can't take you. She may have a message for her husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't she write the message, if you went after I had gone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "NO," said Sadie firmly. "She must send it now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock looked hard at her and nodded. "Well, perhaps it's a good plan.
      Meddling is sometimes dangerous, but one can trust you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie, wrapped in furs, drove across the prairie next afternoon, and found
      Helen at home. The latter looked rather forlorn and dispirited, and Sadie
      felt that she had undertaken a delicate task.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bob has come home for three days," she said by and by. "He can't stop
      longer, but I thought you'd like to know how they are getting on with
      their contract."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stephen writes to me," Helen replied with a hint of sharpness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess he does," Sadie agreed. "Still, from what Bob says, they haven't
      much time for letters, and he talked to me about the work all last
      evening. He could leave when Stephen couldn't because he's the junior
      partner and doesn't know much about railroading yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen smiled, rather curiously. "Do you feel you must explain why your
      husband came home and mine did not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment or two Sadie hesitated. It looked as if she had not begun
      well, but she braced herself. If her tact were faulty, she would try
      frankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she said; "in a way that was what I did come to explain, though
      it's difficult. In the first place, I know why Stephen couldn't come."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen waited, and then, as Sadie seemed to need some encouragement, said,
      "Very well. I think I'd like to be convinced."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The reason Bob came and Stephen stayed begins with the difference between
      them. We know them both, and I want to state that I'm quite satisfied with
      Bob. That had to be said, and now we'll let it go. But they are different.
      Bob will work for an object; for dollars, to feel he's making good, or to
      please me. Your husband must work, whether he had an object or not,
      because that's the kind of man he is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bob's way is easier understood," Helen rejoined. "Besides, Stephen is
      working for money enough to farm again on the old large scale."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is; but you don't understand yet, and I want to show you why he feels
      he has got to farm. Stephen's the kind we have most use for in this
      country. In fact, he's my kind; perhaps I know him better than you. Give
      him a patch of pine-scrub or a bit of poor soil in a sand-belt and he'd
      feel it his duty to cultivate it, no matter how much work it cost. Show
      him good wheat land lying vacant or rocks that block a railroad, and he
      won't rest till he starts the gang-plow or gets to work with giant-powder.
      He can't help it; the thing's born in him. Like liquor or gambling, only
      cleaner!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But when such a man marries&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about his wife? Well, she must help all she can or stand out and let
      him work alone. It's a sure thing she can't stop him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen pondered, and then remarked: "Stephen is not your kind, as you said.
      You wanted to leave the prairie and live in a town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I certainly did, but I didn't know myself. Though I wanted to meet smart
      people and wear smart clothes, to push Bob on and see him make his mark in
      big business or perhaps in politics. Now I know I really wanted power; to
      order folks about and get things done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You found you must give up your ambitions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw they had to be altered," Sadie replied. "But when you can't get
      things done by others, you can do them, in a smaller way, yourself, and I
      find I can be satisfied with running a prairie farm as it ought to be
      run." She paused and resumed with a soft laugh: "Looks as if neither of us
      was fixed quite as we like. I have a husband who must be hustled; you want
      to hold yours back. Well, I guess we can't change that; we must take the
      boys for what they are and make allowances. Besides, your man's fine
      energy is perhaps the best thing he has."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen was somewhat moved. Sadie's rude philosophy was founded on truth,
      and having made sacrifices, she had a right to preach. After all, to dull
      the fine edge of Stephen's energy would be an unworthy action and perhaps
      dangerous. Helen had been jealous of his farm, but admitted that she might
      have had worse rivals.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know 'The Sons of Martha'?" she asked and recited a verse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's great," said Sadie simply. "That man has our folks placed. Well, I
      don't read much poetry, but there's a piece of Whitman's I like. When I
      watch an ox-team break the first furrow in virgin soil, or a construction
      train, loaded with new steel, go by, I hear him calling: 'Pioneers! Oh,
      Pioneers!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a few moments, and then Sadie leaned forward. "I
      don't know if I've said enough, or said too much, but Bob goes back in
      three days and could take a message."
    </p>
    <p>
      The color crept into Helen's face, and her look was strangely soft.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him tell Stephen to finish his work as well as he can; say I
      understand."

      CHAPTER XXVII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      SNOW
    </h3>
    <p>
      Tossing snowflakes filled the air, and although it was three o'clock in
      the afternoon the light was fading, when Charnock opened the door of the
      caboose. A bitter wind rushed past him and eddied about the car, making
      the stove crackle. The iron was red-hot in places and a fierce twinkle
      shone out beneath the rattling door. Half-seen men lay in the bunks along
      the shadowy wall, tools jingled upon the throbbing boards, but the motion
      was gentler than usual and the wheels churned softly instead of hammering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is she going to make it?" somebody asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock leaned out of the door. Black smoke streamed about the cars and
      he heard a heavy snorting some distance off, but the caboose lurched
      slowly along the uneven track. The construction train was climbing a steep
      grade, the driving wheels slipped and he doubted if the locomotive could
      reach the summit, from which the line ran down to the camp. Dim pines,
      hardly distinguishable from the white hillside, drifted past; a shapeless
      rack loomed up and slowly drew abreast. It was some moments before
      Charnock lost it in the tossing white haze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know if she'll make it or not, but rather think she won't," he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then come in and shut the blamed door," another growled. "No need to
      worry about it, anyhow! Pay's as good for stopping in the caboose as for
      humping rails in the snow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're luckier than me in that way," Charnock answered as he shut the
      door. "There are some drawbacks to being your own boss. When you can't get
      to work it's comforting to know that somebody else has to find the dollars
      and put up the hash."
    </p>
    <p>
      He shivered as he sat down on a box. The snow was obviously deep and
      things would be unpleasant at the camp, but Festing would not let this
      interfere with work. Charnock thought he had been foolish to come back,
      but Festing expected him and Sadie agreed that he ought to go. It was
      something of an effort to live up to the standards of such a partner and
      such a wife. Sadie was a very good sort, better than he deserved, but he
      would not have minded it if she were not quite so anxious about his moral
      welfare. Besides, after the comfort of the homestead, the caboose jarred.
      It smelt of acrid soft-coal smoke, the air was full of dust, and rubbish
      jolted about the floor. Then Charnock grinned as he admitted that he had
      not expected to find the path of virtue smooth.
    </p>
    <p>
      His reflections were rudely disturbed, for a violent jolt threw him off
      the box. The boards he fell upon no longer throbbed, and it was evident
      that the train had stopped. The others laughed as he got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Loco's hit a big drift," said one. "I guess the engineer won't butt her
      through."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'll surely try; Jake hates to be beat," another remarked, and the
      caboose began to shake as the train ran backwards down the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute or two later there was a savage jerk and a furious snorting. The
      caboose rolled ahead again, faster than before, for the wheels had cut a
      channel through the snow, and somebody said, "Watch out! Hold tight when
      she jumps!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The speed slackened, a jarring crash ran backwards along the train, and
      the caboose tilted as if the wheels had left the rails. Tools and sacks of
      provisions rolled across the inclined floor, which suddenly sank to a
      level, and a man who had fallen from his bunk got up and opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's bedded in good and fast. Guess Jake will be satisfied now," he
      said, and laughed when a whistle rang through the snow. "Nobody could hear
      that a mile ahead, and as she's not over the divide it's some way to camp.
      I reckon we'll stop here until they dig us out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon afterwards some more men came in, covered with snow. Then the door
      was shut, the stove filled and a lamp lighted, and Charnock resigned
      himself to spending another night in the caboose. After all, it was as
      warm as the shack, and he reflected with some amusement that Festing
      probably did not expect him to be punctual. The latter knew his habits,
      and no doubt imagined that he would find the comfort of the homestead
      seductive. But Festing did not know Sadie, who had sent him back within
      the promised time. He enjoyed his supper and slept well afterwards. In
      fact, he did not waken until a stinging draught swept through the caboose
      and he saw that it was daylight. The door was open and he heard voices
      outside. He recognized one as the foreman's, and presently the fellow came
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "D'you reckon you're here for good, you blamed hibernating deadbeats?" he
      asked the occupants of the bunks. "Turn out and get busy before I put a
      move on you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The men got up, grumbling, and Charnock buttoned his skin-coat and jumped
      down into the snow. He sank to his knees, but went deeper before he
      reached the engine, round which a gang of men were at work with shovels.
      It was not his business to help them and he floundered on up the track
      they had made until he crossed the summit and saw the bridge in the
      distance. Half an hour afterwards he met Festing and thought he looked
      surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You didn't come with the boys to dig us out," Charnock remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Festing. "We knew the train had passed the Butte, and guessed
      where she was held up. But I hardly thought&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You didn't think I'd be up to time?" Charnock suggested. "Well, it's
      remarkable what a good example does!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you see Helen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sadie saw her. I understand she was very well and sent you a message.
      You're to finish your job and make good&mdash;Helen understands."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing was silent a moment, and when he looked up his eyes were soft.
      "Thank you, Bob! Or perhaps it's Sadie I ought to thank?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't bother about it. Sadie's fond of meddling," Charnock answered
      with some embarrassment. "But will the snow stop the work?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not altogether. We can keep busy on the hill and I'm going up now. Will
      you come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Presently," said Charnock, smiling. "Food's a thing you don't seem to
      need when you're occupied, but I want my breakfast before I start."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing went away, and after a time Charnock joined him on the hill, where
      fresh trees had been felled and roughly squared with the ax. Men and
      horses were working hard, but Charnock stopped for a minute or two before
      he began. The snow was different from the thin covering that scarcely hid
      the short grass on the plains. The pines were glittering white pyramids,
      with branches that bent beneath their load, and there were no inequalities
      on the drop to the river. Every projection was leveled up, the hollows
      were filled, and the snow ran unbroken among the trunks in a smooth white
      sheet. It was not drying and getting powdery, because the frost was not
      very keen, and he imagined that Festing meant to get as much lumber as
      possible down while the surface could be beaten into a smooth track.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might take Gordon's team and break a trail by hauling the lighter
      pieces to the top," Festing said. "They'll run down when they have worn a
      chute, but we'll have some trouble man-handling the first."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock nodded as he glanced over the edge of the narrow tableland. The
      descent was not steep near the top, but farther on it dropped
      precipitously to the water, crossing the curve by the bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How will you stop the heavy stuff going into the river?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing indicated two men moving about the waterside. They looked
      curiously stumpy with their legs buried in the snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I sent them to make a chain fast to the rocks. We'll shackle up the first
      logs we run down and make a lumber pond. A few may shoot across the top,
      but we'll see what must be done as we get on."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock hooked the chain round the smallest log he could find and started
      the horses. They slipped and floundered as they plodded through the soft
      snow. Sometimes the log ran for a few yards, crushing down the surface,
      but it often sank overhead and the team struggled hard to drag it out. For
      all that, Charnock reached the top of the slope, and turning back, widened
      the trail he had made. The next log ran easier, although it gave him
      trouble, but when he stopped at noon he had beaten down a road.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they started again he left the team to somebody else and joined the
      men who were clearing out a trough down the hill. This was harder work,
      but the small contractor finds it pays to give his men a lead instead of
      orders, and for a time Charnock used the shovel and his feet. Then Festing
      said they had better move a few logs as far as they would go, and they
      worked the first trunk down hill with handspikes and tackles. The lumber
      scored the bottom of the trough and would not run, and they struggled
      through the banked-up snow, lifting the heavy mass when it sank. Now and
      then they fixed the tackle to a tree and dragged the log across short
      skids thrust under its end, and at length launched it from the brow of the
      steeper pitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      It plunged down some distance, but stopped again, half buried in loose
      snow, and they scrambled after it, clinging to small trees. Then the work
      got dangerous. One could scarcely stand on the steep bank, and when the
      log started it rather leaped than slid. Spikes, torn from the men's hands,
      shot into the air, and those in front sprang back for their lives, but the
      mass seldom went far before loose snow brought it up and the struggle with
      the levers began again. At last, it slipped from a hummock and glided
      slowly down, crumpling the snow in front, while a man, clinging to the
      butt and shouting hoarse jokes, trailed down the track behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moving the next was easier, and those that followed ran without much help
      for most of the way, while when dark came the bank at the top was empty
      and there was a pile of logs held up by the chain at the waterside. Their
      descent had worn the channel smooth, and it was now difficult to stop them
      going too far. In a day or two Festing brought the most part of his
      material to the spot where it would be used, and got ready to put up the
      frames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stinging frost set in, and on the morning they cleared the ground for the
      first post Charnock felt daunted as he beat his numbed hands. The sky was
      clear; a hard, dazzling blue, against which the white peaks were
      silhouetted with every ridge and pinnacle in sharp outline. They twinkled
      like steel in places, but there were patches of delicate gray, and here
      and there a dark rock broke through its covering. The bottom of the gorge
      was soft blue, and the river a streak of raw indigo, but there was no
      touch of warm color in the savage landscape. The glitter made Charnock's
      eyes ache and the reflected sunshine burned his skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the construction gangs were laid off, but in places men were at
      work. They looked small and feeble on the vast white slope, and a few
      plumes of smoke seemed to curl futilely out of the hollow. Frost and snow
      defied man's engine power, and the rattle of the machines was lost in the
      din the river made. Its channel was full of snow that had frozen in the
      honey-combed masses, and the ragged floes broke with a harsh, ringing
      crash. Others screamed as they smashed among the rocks and ground across
      ledges, while the tall cliffs on the opposite bank flung the echoes far
      among the pines. The uproar rose and sank, but its throbbing note voiced a
      challenge to human effort, and Charnock admitted that had the choice been
      left to him, he would have gone back to the warm shack and waited for
      better conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing, however, would wait for nothing, and Kerr and Norton were equally
      resolute. Just now Festing was clearing away the snow while three or four
      men cautiously descended the bank, dragging loads of branches. A big fire
      was soon lighted, and when the resinous wood broke into snapping flame
      Festing cleared a spot farther on for another. By and by he scattered the
      first, the thawed surface was pierced, and a hole dug. Then with half an
      hour's savage labor they got the first big post on end. The next broke the
      supporting tackle and a man narrowly escaped when it fell, but they raised
      it again and got to work upon the braces. The wood was unseasoned and hard
      with frozen sap. Saw and auger would scarcely bite, but somehow they cut
      the notches and bored the holes. When the first frame was roughly stayed
      Charnock sat down with a breathless laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose it's the best job we can make and it's up to specification.
      Still, when one comes to think of it, the optimism of these railroad men
      is remarkable. Green wood and uncovered bolts that will soon work loose in
      the rotting pine! If I was an engineer, the thing would frighten me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The track will stand while they want it," Festing answered with an
      impatient look. "Long before it gets shaky they'll pull it down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pulling things down is a national habit. A man I met in Winnipeg bought a
      nearly new hotel because he thought he could put up a better building on
      the site. However, I suppose there's something to be said for his point of
      view. Progress implies continuous moving on!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does," said Festing. "While you moralize, the men you ought to put to
      work are standing still."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock got up and went off, beating his hands. He noted that there was a
      hole in the mittens he had brought from home. This was annoying because
      Sadie had given him the mittens. In spite of many difficulties, they
      braced the posts securely before they stopped work, and when supper was
      over Charnock reluctantly put on his coat. He wanted to ask Norton
      something, and when he left the latter's office came back along a narrow
      path above the track. After going a short distance he stopped to look down
      at the half-finished frames.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon had not risen, but a pale glow shone above a gray peak and the
      sky was clear. One could not see much in the hollow, but the snow
      reflected a faint light. The timbers they had erected rose like a black
      skeleton, and after glancing at them, Charnock's eyes were drawn towards
      the pile of logs in the pond at the water's edge. A log pond is generally
      made in a river, where the stream will carry the trunks into the
      containing chains. But Festing had made his on land, using the snow
      instead of the current. Charnock could not tell what had attracted his
      attention, but stood motionless for a moment or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard nothing but the roar of the current and the crash of splintering
      ice, and could hardly distinguish the logs. Their outline was blurred and
      the dark-colored mass melted into a dusky background of rock and water.
      Yet he thought something had moved beside the pond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then an indistinct object detached itself from the pile. It was shapeless
      and he lost it next moment, but it had been visible against a patch of
      snow. It was not a man's height, and, so far as he could see, moved like
      an animal, but no wild beast would haunt the outskirts of a noisy
      construction camp. Since he could not imagine why a man should crawl about
      the logs at night, he resolved to satisfy his curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This needed caution, and he lay down and rolled himself in the snow. It
      stuck to his shaggy skin-coat, and remembering that some drills had been
      left near the track he felt about until he found one. The short steel bar
      was easy to carry and might be useful. The next thing was to get down
      without being seen, and he crept to the log-slide and sitting down let
      himself go. His coat rolled up and acted like a brake, but he reached and
      shot over the top of the last pitch. Next moment he struck the logs at the
      bottom with a jar that left him breathless, and he lay still to recover.
      His coat was white; indeed, the snow had forced its way inside his
      clothes, but he must be careful about his background and avoid abrupt
      movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting on his hands and knees, he crawled along the bottom of the pile.
      The logs were not numerous, since some had been used, and when Charnock
      reached the end he crouched in the snow and looked about. Nobody was there
      and his ears were not of much use because the crash of ice drowned every
      other sound. This made silence needless, and he tried to get between the
      logs and the water, but found it dangerous. The chain had sagged with the
      strain, and the lowest tier was scarcely a foot from the bank, along which
      the ice-floes rasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came back and crawled half-way up the pile, meaning to reach the top,
      but stopped and lay flat. An object moved along the highest row, and he
      knew it was a man. The fellow's figure showed against the sky, though
      Charnock imagined he would have been invisible from above. He waited and
      felt his heart beat as he clenched the bar. The other did not seem to know
      he was watched and Charnock resolved to find out what he meant to do. He
      thought of the chain that held the logs; if this were loosed, the pile
      would roll into the river and be washed away, but it would be impossible
      to slip the fastening toggle while the links were strained. Still one
      might be nicked with a hacksaw and left to break with the shock when the
      next log ran down the slide. The man, however, could not get at the chain
      from the top row.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came nearer and then stopped abruptly, as if alarmed. Charnock lay
      close in the hollow between two logs, but his coat was snowy and it was
      possible that the other had noticed the white patch. He turned and began
      to move back, not fast but with caution. Charnock felt it was unthinkable
      that he should get away, and raising himself, swung the drill round his
      head and let it go. It flew over the other man and vanished without a
      sound because the turmoil of the water drowned the splash, but Charnock
      lost his balance and rolled off the logs. He fell into the snow, and when
      he got up the man had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments he stood still, hesitating and abusing his folly. He did
      not know if the fellow had seen the drill fly past or not, but he had
      thrown away his weapon, and might have a dangerous antagonist. For all
      that, he meant to discover who his antagonist was. Floundering through the
      snow, he reached the end of the pile, but found nobody there. The lumber
      gang had made a path along the water's edge, but Charnock could see nobody
      among the scattered trees. He climbed to the top of the logs and looked
      down on the other side, but saw nothing between the water and the pile.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, he felt the fastening of the chain, which did not seem to have
      been tampered with, because the toggle was securely fixed across the
      strap-link. Then he crept about the pile again, with an uncomfortable
      feeling that the other might be lying in wait for him, but saw nothing
      suspicious, and there was no use in examining the trampled snow. By and by
      he gave up the search and returned to the path, feeling disturbed. It was
      impossible to guess what the man had meant to do, or who he was, but
      Charnock resolved to watch.

      CHAPTER XXVIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE LEWIS BOLT
    </h3>
    <p>
      Charnock went back next morning and examined the chain, but found none of
      the links or fastenings damaged. This was puzzling, and he wondered
      whether the man he had seen, knowing that somebody was about, had stolen
      away without beginning what he came to do. The explanation was plausible,
      but left Charnock uncertain who the fellow was. He suspected Wilkinson,
      but only because he could think of nobody else with any ground for wishing
      to do him or Festing an injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, he thought it better not to tell Festing. It was rather an
      improbable story, and Stephen might think him imaginative, but he would
      watch and try to catch the fellow if he came again. For a week, he made
      excuses for going out after supper, and Festing did not object although he
      looked surprised, but he saw nothing and it was very cold lurking about
      the track. Moreover he was generally tired after his day's hard work, and
      was glad to give up the search.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time later, he returned from Norton's office one night and had
      reached the track when he saw a man coming obliquely up the slope. There
      was moonlight, and the snow glittered between the shadows of the trees.
      Charnock saw the other plainly and drew back into the gloom along the
      bank. The fellow did not seem to mind whether he was seen or not, but
      Charnock thought he knew his walk and figure, and when he reached the
      track set off with the object of overtaking him. The loose snow dulled his
      steps, and he was close upon the man when the latter stopped and turned.
      Then Charnock saw, without much surprise, that it was Wilkinson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What were you doing down there?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see what that has to do with you," Wilkinson answered coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The logs in the pond are ours."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson looked amused and Charnock tried to control his temper. He would
      gain nothing by using force, and thought the other meant to give him no
      excuse for doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't imagine I meant to steal your logs!" Wilkinson rejoined.
      "They're too large to carry away, and there's no sawmill to buy them if I
      sent them down the river."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's obvious," said Charnock, who thought it prudent not to hint that
      he had seen the fellow lurking about the pond before. For that matter, he
      was not certain he had seen Wilkinson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're much more suspicious than you were when I first knew you,"
      Wilkinson resumed in a mocking tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was a confiding fool then and trusted my friends. It cost me
      something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now you're afraid to let anybody pass your logs in the dark? Well,
      caution's useful, but it can be overdone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you want to pass the pond?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For one thing, because it's the easiest way of getting from the smithy to
      the track; then this piece of hillside doesn't belong to you. However, as
      I guess you don't claim it, you no doubt reckoned I meant to play you some
      shabby trick; turn your logs adrift, for example?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think it's impossible."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson laughed. "Well, I might do you an injury if the thing wasn't
      difficult, but don't let your suspicions make you ridiculous. If you feel
      uneasy, you can watch the pond. Anyhow, the cold's fierce and I'm going to
      the bunk-house."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock let him go and returned thoughtfully to the shack. He did not
      doubt that Wilkinson had been to the smithy, because one could find out if
      he had not, but he felt disturbed. The fellow had somehow encouraged him
      to believe he might tamper with the logs; but would hardly have done so
      had he meant to set them adrift. He might, of course, have wanted to keep
      him uneasy without ground; but suppose it was a feint, intended to cover
      the real attack, made at another point? Charnock determined to be cautious
      and keep his eyes open.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw nothing to cause him fresh anxiety, although he once or twice
      visited the pond at night. In the daytime his work absorbed his attention,
      for they were now building a lofty frame on the steepest pitch of the dip.
      The foot of the longest timber, which was unusually massive, rested in a
      socket cut in the rock near the water's edge, and it cost them a very hard
      and dangerous day's work to get the log on end. Indeed, for a few anxious
      minutes Charnock imagined that the mass would break the tackles and come
      down. When fixed, it was nearly perpendicular, but its top inclined
      slightly toward the bank, and Festing sent for Norton and Kerr.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a good post, but I'm not sure we have got spread enough," he said.
      "There's not much to resist the outward thrust a heavy train might cause.
      Still, I don't see how we could have carried the foot farther back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd have to go into the water," Norton agreed. "That would have meant a
      coffer dam, and the Company won't stand for expensive extras."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The ice would have smashed the dam," said Kerr. "The job meets the plan,
      which calls for stays to stop the post canting out. Put in an extra
      king-tie half-way up and I'll pass your bill and find the ironwork."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing was satisfied with this, and the post was stayed with chains while
      they got the braces fixed. This took some days, for the men were forced to
      work on dangerous snowy ledges and boards, hung from the top. Where there
      was most risk and difficulty Festing went himself, but he looked anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the worst part of the job and perhaps the most awkward thing I've
      done," he said one night. "If the frame came down with the rockwork
      filling, it might start the rest and shake some length of road."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there's no reason it should come down," Charnock argued.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in a way, but I'm glad Kerr authorized the extra brace. We'll use the
      heaviest stuff we can, and although the fastenings may give some trouble,
      we haven't come to them yet. Perhaps I'm getting nervous. We're up to
      schedule and doing pretty well, but it will be a relief to get the
      contract finished."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock told him about Wilkinson, and he looked thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't see his object, particularly since he left the chain alone. Of
      course he may have meant some mischief, but gave it up when he found you
      on his track."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Somehow I don't think that was it," said Charnock, who went to open the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kerr came in and after a time began to talk about the fastenings for the
      main tie-beam.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As the rock is sound and can be thawed, I think we could use a bolt on
      the Lewis plan. Give me some paper and I'll make a sketch you can take to
      the smith."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock examined the drawing and noted that the holding part of the bolt
      was shaped like the letter Y, except that the stalk was split. A wedge was
      sketched to fit the split, and would obviously expand the upper arms to
      fit tightly into a fan-shaped hole with a narrow mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've not seen this kind of fastening before," he said. "It ought to grip
      well, but something depends upon the wedge."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kerr nodded. "The wedge must be properly forged and fit tight, but there's
      a cross bolt to stop it backing out. So long as it doesn't break under the
      hammer, it can't come loose. Something depends on the way the hole is cut
      and the rock, but the stuff you're working is hard enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Charnock took the drawing to the smith, and calling at the
      forge a day or two later, found Wilkinson sitting on a box. He had brought
      a pick to be mended and made a few ironical remarks, until the smith
      showed Charnock some irons he had forged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess that's what you want, but I haven't finished the Lewis yet.
      Reckoned I'd wait until I could get a bit of horseshoe iron for the wedge
      when the new stores come along."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that bar in the corner?" Charnock asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Steel," said the smith. "A bit off the end would make a wedge, but you
      want to be careful you don't overheat the steel in the forge if it's to
      stand hammering after. Horseshoe iron's better for your particular job.
      Come back in a day or two and I'll have the thing ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock left him and one afternoon soon afterwards helped Festing to
      notch and bore the heavy cross-tie to fit the post and the ends of the
      timbers it was to hold in place. These were intended to strengthen the
      frame, of which the post and tie were the most important members, and
      Festing had waited until their other ends were securely fixed. When the
      light was fading he beckoned Charnock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might get the Lewis bolt. The smith sent word it's ready and I want
      to fasten the tie before we stop."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Charnock reached the forge the smith was absent, but he blew the fire
      until the light flickered about the shop and looked for the bolt. He found
      it in a corner and took the wedge to the hearth. It was properly shaped
      and slotted for a cross-bolt, but it looked rough and scaly, and giving
      the blower a few more strokes he tapped it once or twice. The scale fell
      off and the metal looked sound. Then while the flame spread about the fuel
      he glanced round the shop. There was no horseshoe iron, but the bar of
      steel had recently been cut, and he thought the wedge had been forged out
      of its end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock did not think this mattered much. Festing had urged the smith to
      finish the job, and the man knew his business. Since he had been forced to
      use steel, he had no doubt taken the necessary precautions. It was dark
      when Charnock got back to the frame, but a blast-lamp threw out a dazzling
      glare and he climbed to a beam on which Festing sat. At the timber's inner
      end a fire burned on a shelf of rock and a man was stirring something in
      an iron pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're melting lead to fill up the hole, though I don't know if it's
      necessary," Festing said. "Have you got the bolt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's here. He has made it out of steel; the iron he expected hasn't
      arrived."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all right. They now use steel for many jobs instead of iron, and
      the softer kinds are quite as tough. Anyhow, we can trust the smith not to
      burn the metal. Help Black while I get the tie ready for fastening."
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later the big cross-beam was in position and Charnock watched
      Festing fit the bolt into its fan-shaped socket. He did so with fastidious
      care and then standing on the beam swung the hammer a workman gave him.
      The blast-lamp roared upon a timber overhead, throwing down waves of light
      that flooded the rock face, but the twinkling brightness rather puzzled
      the eye. For all that, Festing struck the wedge squarely and drove it home
      with a few heavy blows. Then he fastened the cross-bolt and Charnock
      filled a ladle with the melted lead. A blue flame flickered about the
      cavity as he poured in the stuff, there was an angry sputtering, and he
      afterwards found some holes in his coat. Festing dropped his hammer with a
      gesture of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's an awkward piece of work finished, and I feel happier now! You can
      put out the lamp and quit, boys; I'll mark you up full time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they got down from the frame and went home to supper, earlier than
      usual. In the morning they began to build a wall of roughly-cut stones
      among the timber, filling in the space behind with rubble; and kept on
      until at noon, a day or two later, heavy snow began to fall. It was
      impossible to work, and they lounged about the shack, smoking and reading,
      all next day. Charnock was thankful for the rest, but Festing grumbled and
      now and then walked impatiently to the door. Late at night the former was
      wakened by a distant rumbling. It sounded like thunder, and he called to
      his comrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that? Had we better get up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sounds like a big snow-slide," said Festing, raising himself in his bunk.
      "Won't harm us; shack's on top of the ridge and we're safer here than
      anywhere else." He stopped and listened to the swelling roar and then
      resumed: "I'm glad we got that frame braced. It's a big slide and will
      probably come down the gully near the bridge. They're going to snowshed
      that piece of track and we'll haul out the posts if we can't get on with
      the other job."
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay down again, but Charnock waited. This was the first snow-slide he
      had heard and he felt awed by the din. Growing in a long crescendo, it
      rolled down the hill in a torrent of sound, but by and by he thought he
      could distinguish different notes; the crash of trees carried away by the
      avalanche and the scream of gravel grinding across rocky scraps. He could
      imagine the stones being planed away and the mass of broken trunks riding
      on top of the huge white billow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to sit still, and jumping down, he lighted the lamp, but
      found it hard to replace the glass. The shack throbbed, the table on which
      he put the matches shook, and there was a rattle of crockery, but this was
      drowned by an overwhelming roar. The avalanche was pouring down a gully
      near the shack, and he leaned against the table, deafened, until it
      passed. Then he heard the turmoil of a tremendous cataract and imagined
      the snow was plunging into the river and deflecting the current upon the
      other bank. The sound gradually died away and he could hear detached
      noises; great pines, broken rocks, and soil, rushing down behind the
      fallen mass. There were heavy splashes, and then a strange, unnatural
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's finished," Festing remarked. "Rather alarming for the first time,
      but one gets used to it. You can put out the light and go back to bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock did so and soon went to sleep. In the morning they found that the
      most part of the avalanche had fallen into the river, but its tail
      remained, resting in a steep cone of snow and broken trees and soil,
      against the bank on which they had built the frames. The top of the cone
      extended far up the hill, but, owing to the sharpness of the pitch, its
      bottom, which covered the frames and rockwork, was thin. Festing sent half
      the men to cut this portion away, and the others up the hill to haul posts
      for the snowshed to the top of the slides. It was obvious that a very
      heavy weight rested on the buried work, but the pressure was uniform,
      unlike the jarring of a train, and he did not feel disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      About four o'clock in the afternoon he came to see how much progress the
      shovel gang had made, and Charnock, who superintended their labor, showed
      him what they had done. They had cut a gap in the cone, and part of the
      rockwork was exposed nearly to the bottom. On each side, the snow ran down
      to the water in a uniform smooth slant, except where broken trees
      projected from the surface. Above, the mass of snow rested on the shelf
      that would carry the track and on the top of the half-finished work. It
      glittered with a yellow flush where it caught the fading light, but in the
      hollow its color was a dull, cold blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by they examined the wall. So far as they could see, the stonework
      bore the unusual load well, but in one spot there was a crack between two
      courses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll get up there in the morning and see if it's worth while to drive in
      a few wedges," Festing remarked. "You had better watch that bank of snow.
      Some of it will probably break away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have had two or three small falls," said Charnock, and Festing
      beckoned one of the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come up the hill in the morning, Tom. I'm going to clear the log-slide or
      break a new one. Which d'you think would be best?"
    </p>
    <p>
      While they talked about it, a shower of snow fell on Charnock, who stepped
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Watch out!" he cried. "There's more coming!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing moved a pace or two and went on talking, but Charnock fixed his
      eyes on the snow. The part above the track overhung the gap in a bulging
      cornice, as if it was moving down hill, and in a few moments a heavier
      shower began. The bulge got more prominent, but the cornice did not break
      off, and while he watched it, wondering whether he should call out the
      men, a stone fell from the wall and dropped at his feet. This was ominous,
      but next moment a mass of snow struck his head, nearly knocking him down,
      and when he recovered his balance and wiped his face he noted with alarm
      that the stones were opening and the big post leaned outwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jump for your lives, boys!" he shouted, and throwing himself on Festing,
      drove him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was a roar of falling stones and a crash. The massive post
      lurched towards him and the air was filled with snow. He heard struts and
      braces crack as the post tore them out, and thought Festing turned round
      in order to see what was happening. He pushed him away, and then sank into
      loose snow and fell. Before he could get up there was a deafening noise,
      something struck him a heavy blow, and he was buried.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short struggle he got his head out, and finding that he was thinly
      covered, made an effort to extricate himself. When he had done so, he saw
      the men some distance up the bank. They were all there except Festing, but
      he noticed a heap of big stones and broken beams close by.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Back here, boys! The boss is underneath!" he shouted, and threw himself
      upon the stones as the others ran up.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a minute or two they worked desperately, flinging the lumps of rock
      about and dragging away the beams; and then stopped as they uncovered
      Festing. His face looked very white, although a red stain ran down his
      forehead. Charnock shivered and glanced at the break in the white mass
      above the track.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's risky, but we've got to pull him out before some more snow comes
      down," he said in a hoarse voice. "Scrape the snow off carefully, Tom. Get
      hold here with me, Pete."
    </p>
    <p>
      After two or three minutes' cautious work they lifted Festing out of the
      hole. He was unconscious and his arm looked short and distorted. Charnock
      felt horror-struck and dizzy, but pulled himself together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go for Kerr, one of you," he said. "Then I want the stretcher and a
      hand-sledge. Bring a blast-lamp; ours is smashed."
    </p>
    <p>
      The men scattered, except for one who stayed with him, and kneeling in the
      snow he opened Festing's fur-coat and took off his cap. His head was cut
      and his arm broken, but Charnock did not think this altogether accounted
      for his unconsciousness. He suspected broken ribs, but could detect
      nothing unusual when he felt his comrade's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kerr arrived first and looked at Festing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unconscious all the time?" he asked, and when Charnock nodded resumed:
      "Most important thing's to get a doctor, and I'll see to that. Then I'll
      get some brandy."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he hurried away three or four men came down the hill with the sledge
      and stretcher, and one rigged and lighted a powerful lamp. Accidents are
      common at construction camps, and one of Norton's gang examined Festing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's sure got it badly; arm's not the worst," he said. "We'll tend to
      that and then slide him gently on the stretcher. Carrying him might be
      dangerous; we'll fix the whole outfit on the sled."
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were occupied a plume of smoke shot up above the pines, and
      Charnock knew Kerr had sent off a locomotive to bring help. When they had
      put Festing on the stretcher a man arrived with brandy, but Festing could
      not swallow, and seizing the sledge traces, they started up the hill.
      Norton was in the shack when they reached it, and felt Festing's clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not damp; it would be safer to let him lie until the doctor comes," he
      said, and sent the men away. Then he turned to Charnock sharply. "Sit
      right down!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock swayed, clutched the chair, and sank limply into the seat. The
      floor heaved and the quiet figure on the stretcher got indistinct. Then
      Norton held out a glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drink it quick!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock's teeth rattled against the glass, but he swallowed the liquor,
      and sat motionless for a moment or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seemed to lose my balance. Bit of a shock you know, and I expect that
      stone hit me pretty hard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I imagine; there's an ugly bruise on your face," said Norton, giving
      him back the glass. "The first dose braced you. Take some more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think not," said Charnock, with a forced smile. "Dangerous remedy if
      you have suffered from my complaint. Didn't know my face was hurt until
      you told me. When d'you think the doctor will come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a man at Jackson's Bench. Loco ought to make the double trip in
      about two hours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two hours!" said Charnock faintly, and braced himself to wait.

      CHAPTER XXIX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      FOUL PLAY
    </h3>
    <p>
      Some time after the accident a doctor arrived and set Festing's arm. He
      found two ribs were broken and suspected other injuries, but could not
      question his half conscious patient. When he had done all that was
      possible in the meantime and had seen Festing lifted carefully into his
      bunk, he put a dressing on Charnock's bruised face and pulled a chair to
      the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll keep watch; your partner has got an ugly knock," he said. "Don't
      think I'll want anything, and you had better go to bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock could not sleep and spent the night uncomfortably on a chair. He
      was sore and dazed, but his anxiety would not let him rest, and once or
      twice he softly crossed the floor to his comrade's bunk. The last time he
      did so the doctor, whose head had fallen forward, looked up with a jerk
      and frowned as he signed him to go back. After this, Charnock kept as
      still as his jarred nerves would permit. Sometimes Festing groaned, and
      sometimes made a feeble movement, but so far as Charnock could see, his
      eyes were shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      About three o'clock in the morning, the doctor stood for some minutes
      beside the bunk, and Charnock shivered as he watched his face. The shack
      seemed very quiet except for the throb of the river and the grinding of
      the ice. Then the doctor gave him a nod that hinted at satisfaction, and
      told him to refill the iron drum at Festing's feet with hot water. By and
      by he put fresh wood in the stove, moving cautiously and taking as long as
      possible, because it was a relief to do something after sitting still in
      suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      At daybreak there was a knock at the door, and Charnock, finding Kerr and
      Norton outside, looked at the doctor, who put on his fur-coat and went out
      to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you any news for us?" Norton asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No change yet. That's encouraging, as far as it goes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about breakfast? Ours is ready. Will you join us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think not. If my patient doesn't come out of his stupor, I must try to
      rouse him soon. Send a man here and take Mr. Charnock. I expect he needs
      food."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said Kerr. "We'll see the cook looks after you; but can you
      give us no idea about Festing? You see, there are matters, business
      matters&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has had a bad shock and it will be a long job; a month anyway. I can't
      stop long and he ought to have a nurse, although it would be difficult to
      get one to come here. But I can't form an opinion yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      He dismissed them and Kerr took Charnock away. It was very cold. The white
      pines were growing into shape; their tops caught the light in the east and
      glimmered with a faint warm flush against the dim blue shadow. Smoke and
      puffs of steam floated up from the gorge, and the ringing clang of steel
      pierced the turmoil of the river. Charnock felt braced but dizzy. Now he
      came to think of it, he had eaten no supper, and after a day of laborious
      effort the night's watch had fatigued him. Besides, his face smarted under
      the bandage, and his back was sore.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he sat down in Norton's shack, where a plate was put for Kerr, he
      felt ravenously hungry and did not talk much until the meal was over. Then
      Norton made him sit near the stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's an awkward business," he said. "To begin with, what are we going to
      do about a nurse? This is hardly the place for a woman, and I doubt if we
      could get anybody to undertake the job."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll write to Mrs. Festing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would she come out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I imagine so," said Charnock thoughtfully. "Still she doesn't know much
      about nursing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His wife is the proper person to look after him," Kerr interposed. "Then
      I have a young fellow in the rail gang who could help; found him useful
      once or twice when the boys got hurt. In fact, I suspect he's had some
      medical training, though I didn't ask why he quit."
    </p>
    <p>
      Norton smiled. It is not unusual to find men whose professional career has
      been cut short working on a Western track.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That simplifies matters. If you had wanted a lawyer or an accountant, I
      could have sent a man. However, there's another thing&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is; it's important," Kerr agreed. "Who's going to carry on the
      contract?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock leaned forward eagerly. "I'll try. Give me a chance. I think I
      know my job."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a few moments and Norton looked at Kerr, who slowly
      filled his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd like to consent," he said, "but I'm the Company's servant and there's
      a risk." He paused and turned to Norton. "However, it's really your
      business. If things go wrong, the trouble's coming to you first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure. I'm willing to take the risk. I don't expect Charnock will fool the
      job, but if he does you can get after me. I'll stand for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well! We'll let it go at that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock got up, with some color in his bandaged face, because he knew
      what Norton's confidence meant. He was, so to speak, an unknown man and
      the contract had been given to Festing, who was an engineer. If he failed,
      the men who trusted him would be held accountable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you both," he said with feeling. "If labor and money can put the
      thing over, I won't let you down."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out, for he had, in his anxiety about other matters, forgotten his
      men, and it was now important that no time, which must be paid for, should
      be wasted. Finding some of the gang at work clearing away the fallen
      material and some hauling lumber on the hill, he gave them a few orders
      and returned to the shack. When he got there Festing was conscious and the
      doctor said he might speak to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you feel?" Charnock asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better than the doctor thinks I ought to feel," Festing answered with a
      feeble smile. "You seem to have got knocked about!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock said he was not much the worse, and Festing resumed: "Have you
      seen Norton? What does he say about the contract?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have seen him; you needn't bother. He has left the job to me; I'll
      finish it somehow."
    </p>
    <p>
      A look of relief came into Festing's face. "That's comforting news; I was
      afraid&mdash;You're a good partner, Bob!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know if I've been of much help so far, and the money I put into
      the undertaking wasn't mine. There's a third partner, Stephen, and I think
      she'd like me to see you through."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing gave him a grateful glance and closed his eyes. After a time, he
      opened them feebly and asked: "Do you know why the frame gave way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet," said Charnock with some dryness. "I mean to find out!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the doctor interrupted and sent him away. Going back to the scene of
      the accident, he found the damage less serious than he thought. Part of
      the wall had fallen and the post, which had broken, had pulled down the
      timbers attached, but these could be replaced, and Charnock, calling two
      men, began to clear the snow from the king-tie, which he imagined had
      given way first. He found the Lewis bolt fixed to its end, but the wedge
      had gone, and he climbed to the spot where the end of the beam had been
      fixed. The stone socket had not broken, but pieces of crushed lead lay
      near the hole. The soft metal had not much holding power and had been used
      to fill up the crevices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting down, he began with methodical patience to turn over the snow and
      loose rubble that remained on the shelf after the large stones had fallen.
      The odds were against his finding what he sought, but he persevered for an
      hour and then picked up a piece of broken metal a few inches long. It was
      half of the wedge, which had broken at the slot, but although he searched
      carefully he could not find the other part. Putting the piece in his
      pocket, he went to the forge and, seeing the smith was occupied, sat down
      and filled his pipe. The door was open and the light reflected from the
      snow was strong. Charnock was glad of this, because he wanted to see the
      smith, who presently dropped his hammer and leaned against the hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How's your partner getting on?" he asked. "Mr. Festing's the kind of man
      I like; I was sorry to hear he had got hurt."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock studied the man. His face was pale and wrinkled under the grime,
      but he looked honest, and if his statement was sincere, as Charnock
      thought, it seemed to clear the ground. After giving him a few particulars
      about Festing's injuries, he lighted his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wilkinson's not here to-day," he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's not always here," said the smith. "He comes when there are picks and
      drills that want sharpening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw him once or twice when I was in, and thought he was a friend of
      yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He can swap a good yarn; kind of handy man and sometimes helps me with
      the hammer, but I guess that's all there is to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so," said Charnock carelessly. "This is a warm place for a quiet
      smoke, and the foreman can't tell how long one ought to stop, particularly
      as you're sometimes out at the machine-shop. Do you find the boys meddle
      with your tools if they come in while you're away?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir; there'd be trouble if I did! Besides, nobody comes but
      Wilkinson, and if I'm out he waits."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock nodded, as if it did not matter. He had found out what he wanted
      to know and thought he had not excited the smith's suspicions. Taking the
      broken wedge from his pocket, he put it on the hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expect you know what that is! The Lewis smashed when the frame came
      down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the wedge. Don't see why it broke; plenty metal left, though the
      slot weakened it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's it made of?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Steel. The iron I wanted didn't come; but this is mild, low-carbon
      stuff."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then what's the matter with it. It did break."
    </p>
    <p>
      The smith put the piece into a socket in the anvil and struck it with a
      hammer. The end broke short, and picking up the fragment he went to the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nature's gone out of it; I sure can't understand the thing," he said with
      a puzzled look. "If I hadn't forged the stuff myself, I'd allow it was
      burned."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't often overheat the steel you work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir," said the smith, who took up a piece of metal, pierced with
      holes. "Made this out of the same bar, and it took more forging. Now you
      watch!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He put the object in a vise and hammered down the end, which did not
      break. "That's all right, anyhow; tough and most as soft as iron. But
      steel's sometimes treacherous; you want to be careful&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could you tell by looking at it if a piece was burned?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said the smith thoughtfully, "it's not always easy, but if the
      thing was badly scaled, I'd be suspicious. Of course, there might be some
      scale&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the wedge looked all right when you finished it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It certainly did," said the smith, who hesitated. "Say do you reckon it
      was the bolt going that let down your frame?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So far, I imagine it was the weight of snow. The pile ran back up the
      hill and must have made a crushing load. For all that, I'm curious about
      the wedge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said the other, "If it was the wedge, I'm surely sorry! The blamed
      thing is burned, though I don't know how. But if she was loaded up too
      much, she might have broken anyhow, burned or not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expect so," said Charnock, getting up. "You needn't bother about the
      matter; I'm not blaming you."
    </p>
    <p>
      His face got very grim when he went out, for what he had learned fitted in
      with his suspicions. Wilkinson had heard the smith say that steel could be
      easily spoiled, and sometimes came to the forge when the man was away.
      Then there was the rough, scaly look of the wedge, which had been put out
      of the smith's sight, inside the split shank of the bolt. Everything was
      plain; Charnock knew why the tie gave way and allowed the frame to fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought of the treacherous injury made his blood boil. The thing had
      been so easily done; five minutes' work at the blower, a few strokes with
      a big hammer when the steel was dangerously hot, and then, perhaps, a
      sudden quenching in the snow, when the steel ought to have slowly cooled.
      He had been wrong in thinking men would not risk much for the sake of
      revenge. Wilkinson had foully struck his comrade and perhaps crippled him
      for life. But the cunning brute must be punished, and driven from the
      camp, and when he left should carry marks that would make it difficult to
      forget his offense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock, however, could not at once seek out his antagonist. He had
      promised Festing to carry on the contract; they had had a number of
      setbacks, and the accident would cost them much. Wages were high and it
      was essential that the men should be usefully employed, while there was
      now nobody but himself to superintend the work. Besides, the doctor might
      want him and he must call at the shack every now and then to see how
      Festing was getting on. It looked as if he must leave Wilkinson alone
      until he had more leisure in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a trying day. The doctor sent him errands and sometimes allowed him
      to come in for a few minutes, but his reports were not favorable, and
      Festing was either asleep or too feeble to talk. When work stopped and
      Charnock went to the shack after some hours' absence the doctor looked
      very grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry I must keep you out," he said. "You mean well, but you're
      clumsy, while the young fellow Mr. Kerr sent has had some training and
      knows his job."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then my partner's worse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'll own that I'm anxious about to-night; but if he gets over the
      early morning, I'll have hope. Go to the engineer's shack and I'll send
      you a report, if possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock tried to brace himself as he went away. So far, he had not
      imagined that Festing might die. He had got a shock, but must not let it
      overwhelm him. Thinking hard, he walked to Norton's shack to get some
      food. He was worn out and felt some pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norton gave him supper and offered him room for the night, and Charnock
      forced himself to eat. When the meal was over he lounged in a comfortable
      chair with his eyes shut for a time, and then got up and put on his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you going?" Norton asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've some business at the camp," Charnock replied in a very grim voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out and as he walked down the track met the locomotive engineer,
      who stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that you, Mr. Charnock? Cold's pretty fierce to-night. How's Mr.
      Festing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock had not felt the cold until then, but he shivered and beat his
      hands as he replied that Festing was badly hurt. Then he asked: "Are you
      going out with the loco?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thought I'd finished, but they've wired that the cars are wanted on the
      next section and I've got to run them along."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Charnock. "Have you seen Wilkinson?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Met him going to the bunk-house just before you came up."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock went on, and presently entered the big wooden shed, which was
      full of tobacco smoke and the smell of hot iron and food. The warmth made
      him dizzy after the cold outside. A group of men had gathered about the
      stove, others sat at the dirty table with pipes and newspapers, and a few
      were quarreling about a game of cards, but Charnock could not see them
      distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      One or two looked round as he stopped near the door, dazzled by the light.
      He had pulled off the bandage, and there was a large, dark bruise on his
      face, which was set. His mouth made a firm line and his eyes glittered.
      Then the foreman got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he asked harshly, "what do you want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock gave him a careless glance. The fellow was truculent and had
      bullied Charnock when he worked in his gang, while the latter had
      sometimes replied to his abuse with witty retorts that left a sting.
      Afterwards, he had beaten his persecutor badly in the dispute about the
      borrowed workmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm looking for Wilkinson."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What d'you want him for?" the foreman asked suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's my business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then this is my bunk-house; anyhow, I'm in charge. Guess you'd better get
      back to the bosses' shacks, where you belong."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock noted the sneer, but said quietly, "I'll go as soon as I've had a
      word with Wilkinson."
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to see if Wilkinson was there, and did not think he was, but
      could not be certain. The foreman's manner hinted that he meant to protect
      the fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll go now! D'you want me to put you out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Charnock stood still, and then suddenly lost his self-control
      in a fit of savage rage. He had suffered at the hands of the brute, who
      was trying to prevent his finding Wilkinson. But he did not mean to be
      baulked, and stepped forward with his fists clenched.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not remember who struck first, but got a blow on his body that
      made him gasp. Then he felt his knuckles jar on his antagonist's face, and
      the next moment staggered and fell against a bench that upset with a
      crash. He recovered, bent from the waist to dodge a blow that would have
      felled him, and struck over the other's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foreman reeled, but did not fall, and closed with Charnock, who could
      not get away because of the table. The latter felt his antagonist's
      strength, and there was no room for skill. When he tried to break loose
      his feet struck the upset bench, and the wall was close by. Breathing
      hard, they rocked to and fro in a furious grapple, striking when a hand
      could be loosed, and then fell apart, exhausted. Both were bleeding but
      determined, for deep-rooted dislike had suddenly changed to overpowering
      hate. Moreover Charnock knew the foreman was Wilkinson's friend, and half
      suspected him of a share in the plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime the men gathered round, scarcely giving the fighters room,
      and some, crowded off the floor, mounted the table. Nobody, however,
      interfered. They had no part in the quarrel and did not know what it was
      about, but while a number sympathized with Charnock, it was dangerous to
      offend their boss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock resumed the attack, advancing with a savage rush. The foreman
      gave ground, but stretched out his foot and Charnock, tripping over it,
      plunged forward and fell among the legs of the nearest men. They crowded
      back, and as he got up awkwardly the foreman seized a heavy billet of
      cordwood and flung it at his head. The billet struck his shoulder, but he
      was on his feet, his face set and white, and his eyes vindictively hard.
      It was a foul blow, but there are few rules to hamper men who fight in a
      Western construction camp, and Charnock thought his antagonist meant to
      use a stove-iron that lay close by. Feinting at the other, he dodged and
      seized a pick-handle he had noticed on the floor. He was just in time, for
      the foreman struck at him with the iron. It clashed upon the pick-handle,
      but Charnock got the next blow home and the foreman fell upon the table,
      on which Charnock pinned him down. Then getting his right arm loose, he
      struck with blind fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was seized from behind, and while he struggled to get loose somebody
      gasped: "That's enough! Do you want to kill the man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Charnock hoarsely. "Let me go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Help me choke him off! He's surely mad!" cried the man behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody else got hold of Charnock. He was dragged back, hustled away from
      the table and towards the door. Then the bar was torn from his hands and a
      man pushed him out in the snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have fixed him good," said somebody in a breathless voice. "Go home
      and cool off!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If Wilkinson's inside, I'm coming back," Charnock declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man laughed. "Wilkinson lit out through the store-shed 'bout a minute
      after you came in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock felt faint and dizzy, but tried to think when the fellow banged
      the door. It looked as if Wilkinson knew why he had come, and had stolen
      away after seeing the struggle begin. Moreover he had friends who might go
      after him and tell him what had happened to the foreman. Then he
      remembered that the locomotive engineer had been ordered to move some
      cars, and set off for the track.
    </p>
    <p>
      The snow was rough, he fell into holes, and stubbed his feet against the
      ties, but stumbled on until he heard the locomotive snort. Then there was
      a jar of iron, wheels rattled, and a dark mass in front began to roll
      away. He was too late, and when he stopped and tried to get his breath two
      men came down the track.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did any of the boys go out on the train?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only Wilkinson," one replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's he going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," said the other. "As he took his clothes-bag, it doesn't
      look as if he was coming back."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock set off for Norton's office. He did not know how he got there,
      because a reaction had begun, and he sat down feeling powerless and badly
      shaken.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      UNDERSTANDING
    </h3>
    <p>
      At midnight, Charnock, sitting drowsily in a chair in Norton's office,
      roused himself with a jerk. He was too anxious about Festing to go to bed,
      but bodily fatigue reacted on his brain and dulled his senses. For all
      that, he thought he heard steps in the snow, and getting up quickly went
      to the door. The bitter cold pierced him like a knife and he shivered. A
      man stood outside, and his dark figure, silhouetted against the snow, was
      somehow ominous. Charnock tried to brace himself, for he feared bad news.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" he said hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's Musgrave; the doctor sent me along. Your partner's taken a turn.
      He's going the right way now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock looked at the messenger. His relief was overwhelming and he could
      not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all, but I guess it's good enough, and you can go to sleep," the
      other resumed, and went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he vanished among the trees Charnock returned to his chair. He
      thought he ought to have brought the man in and made him some coffee, but
      he was horribly tired and did not want to move about and talk. Besides, he
      was conscious of a poignant satisfaction that prevented his thinking about
      anything else. While he indulged it a wave of fatigue swept over him and
      his head drooped. He tried to open his eyes but could not, and a few
      minutes later he was sound asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he awoke the sun shone into the office and he felt stiff and cramped,
      but not cold. This was strange, and he glanced at the stove, which he had
      expected to find nearly out. The iron, however, glowed a dull red and he
      could hear the cordwood snapping. Somebody must have put in fresh fuel,
      and looking at his watch he got up with a start. The men had been at work
      for two hours, with nobody to superintend them. Then he heard a movement
      and turning round saw one in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Feeling better, boss?" the fellow asked. "Mr. Kerr told me to come and
      see if you were awake. Said you'd find breakfast ready if you went to his
      place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expect you thought waiting for me to wake was easier than rolling
      logs," Charnock suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well!" said the other; "you won't find we've fooled away much time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock went to Festing's shack and the doctor nodded and indicated his
      comrade's bunk. As Charnock stopped beside it Festing turned his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Things going all right, Bob?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They were last night," said Charnock, with some embarrassment. "I don't
      know about this morning because I've just got up. But how are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing smiled. "Much better; imagine I'm not knocked out yet. You needn't
      bother about being late. The boys are a pretty good crowd, and they like
      you. I'm rather glad you didn't hustle them as much as I wanted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's enough," said the doctor, who followed Charnock to the door and
      gave him a hopeful report.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock ate a very good breakfast in Kerr's shack, but his face was grave
      when he began his work. Luck had put upon him a heavy responsibility, but
      he must shoulder the load. Sadie and Helen and Festing had given him much,
      and now the time had come to pay them back. Moreover, with the
      responsibility had come a chance of proving and, so to speak reinstating,
      himself. He was entangled in a coil from which there was but one way out;
      he must stand by his comrade and finish the contract, or own himself a
      wastrel. The difficulties were obvious, but there was some encouragement.
      Perhaps the hardest battle had been fought, for he had grappled with his
      craving for liquor and thought he had won. Then the pain had not troubled
      him for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men gave him no trouble, and he imagined they worked with more energy
      than usual. Now and then one or another stopped to ask, with obvious
      sincerity, how the boss was getting on; men from the railroad gangs, some
      of whom he scarcely knew, made inquiries, and Charnock felt moved. His
      partner's justice had won him respect, but he saw that some of the
      sympathy was meant for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later he heard the rumble of an approaching supply train and
      walked up the track to meet it. The locomotive stopped farther off than he
      expected, and a woman got down. Running forward, he saw that it was Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stephen's doing well; that's the first thing you'll want to know," he
      said when they met.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it already. A man told me as soon as the train stopped; he seemed
      to guess who I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Charnock; "the boys are very good! It makes me proud to feel
      they all like Stephen. But why didn't you telegraph us? The Company would
      have sent on the message."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen smiled. "I didn't see much use in doing so. You knew when your
      letter would arrive and how long it would take me to come. It's
      significant that you came to meet the train."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps it's characteristic that I came too late to help you down! But
      the engineer stopped short of the usual place, and I really have much to
      do just now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen gave him a quick glance. Bob had not lost his humor, but had gained
      something else. He was thin and haggard, but looked determined. Although
      his smile was frank, his mouth was firm and his eyes were steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know!" she answered quickly; "I know what you have done for Stephen and
      what you mean to do. There is nobody else who can help him and if there
      was, the help would not be like yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Charnock. "I'm afraid you're mistaken about one point,
      but I have an extra reason for doing the best I can." Then he paused and
      smiled. "We tried to make the place comfortable, but you'll find things
      rough. One lives in a rather primitive way at a construction camp."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps, so far, I have found things too smooth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Helen asked him about the accident and he told her as much as he
      thought advisable, until they reached the shack, where the doctor met them
      at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expect you're Mrs. Festing," he said. "You'll find your husband able to
      talk, but remember that he must be kept calm. I'm going out, but will be
      back soon, and we'll see about getting you some food."
    </p>
    <p>
      He took Charnock away, and Festing looked up with a strained expression as
      Helen crossed the floor. Her eyes were wonderfully gentle, and stooping
      beside the bunk she kissed him and put her arm round his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear!" she said softly. "My poor hurt dear! I have come to take care
      of you until you get well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I imagine I'll need to be taken care of afterwards," Festing answered,
      with a forced smile. "It looks as if I hadn't much ground for
      self-confidence."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen pressed his arm. "We have both made mistakes; but we won't talk
      about that now. Do you really feel you're getting better?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," said Festing, smiling. "Very much better! I'll get well
      remarkably fast now you have come."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen brought a chair and for a time they engaged in happy but careless
      talk. Both knew there was much to be said, but Helen skilfully avoided
      striking a serious note. The time for that had not arrived yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it got dark the doctor came in and joined them at a meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The engineers have promised to put me up to-night, and I must leave
      to-morrow when the train goes out," he said. "I'll try to get back, but
      Musgrave knows what to do and will send for me if necessary. The most
      important thing is to keep Mr. Festing quiet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid it will be difficult," Helen answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor's eyes twinkled. "So I imagine, but it's your job. If you find
      it too hard, Musgrave will put your husband in plaster."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went East next morning with the supply train, and Helen was sorry to
      see him go. He had done what was needed with quiet efficiency, but she
      knew he had other patients scattered about a wide district.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock came in for a few minutes now and then during the day, and
      Musgrave was often about, but Helen was content to be left alone with her
      husband. His helplessness moved her; he had been marked by such vigor and
      energy, and it was strange to see him unable to move. Yet, while very
      pitiful, she felt a vague satisfaction because she could help him and he
      needed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was getting dark she went to the door and looked out. The evening
      was calm and belts of pale-yellow broke the soft gray clouds. The eastern
      peaks were touched with an orange glow, but the snow lower down faded
      through shades of blue and purple into gloom. To the west, the pines were
      black and sharp, with white smears on their lower branches, and a thin
      haze rose from the river. The coloring of the landscape was harmoniously
      subdued, but its rugged grandeur of outline caught Helen's eye, and she
      stood for a few minutes, looking about with half-awed admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you feel the cold, Stephen?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Festing. "Wonderful view, isn't it? But what's it like
      outside?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very still. Everything has a soft look; the harsh glitter's gone and the
      air has not the sting it had. Somehow the calm's majestic. The pictures
      one sees of the mountains hardly give a hint; one feels this is the
      grandest country in the world, but it looks strangely unfinished."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing laughed. "A few ranches, roads, and cornfields would make a
      difference? Well, they follow the Steel in Canada and it's my job to clear
      the way. But the soft look promises warmer weather, and Bob will get ahead
      if a Chinook wind begins to blow. I imagine he hasn't done very much the
      last few days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mustn't bother about what Bob is doing," Helen said firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. Light the lamp and sit where I can see you. There's something
      I want to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen did so and waited until Festing resumed: "To begin with, I've been a
      short-sighted, censorious fool about Bob. I'm ashamed to remember that I
      said he was a shiftless wastrel. The worst is I can't apologize; it
      wouldn't make things better to tell him what I thought."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's obvious," said Helen, with a smile. "Still, in a way perhaps, you
      were not so very wrong. Bob was something of a wastrel; his wife has made
      him a useful man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another thing I was mistaken about! I rather despised Sadie. Now I want
      to take off my hat when I think of her. But it's puzzling. A girl without
      polish, taste, or accomplishments marries a man who has them all. She has
      no particular talents; nothing, in fact, except some beauty, rude
      integrity, and native shrewdness. Yet she, so to speak, works wonders.
      Puts Bob on his feet and leads him on, when nobody else could have pulled
      him out of the mire!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She loved him," said Helen softly. "Love gave her patience and
      cleverness. However, I think Sadie did not always lead Bob. She knew when
      to drive."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing was silent for a few moments and then went on: "Well, I have
      confessed two blunders and think it has done me good; but I'm getting
      nearer what I want to say. Bob's something of a philosopher and once
      remarked that events and people seldom force us into coils; our passions
      and characters entangle us. He was scoffing at the power of the theatrical
      villain and used Wilkinson for an example."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Wilkinson had something to do with our troubles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not very much, after all. Perhaps he's accountable for my broken bones,
      but it was my obstinacy and ridiculous self-confidence that sent me here.
      That's what I really mean to talk about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it necessary?" Helen asked. "I was foolish to be jealous of the farm.
      Women have sometimes worse grounds for jealousy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would have been impossible for us! Nobody who knew you could be
      attracted by another woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bob was attracted," said Helen with a blush. "One must own that he was
      prudent. I haven't Sadie's courage and patience."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In those days, Bob was a besotted whisky-tank; but we are not going to
      talk about him. I'm afraid I was forgetful and went my own way like an
      obstinate fool. It was wrong, ridiculously wrong; I'm not going to excuse
      myself, but I want you to understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, for effort and emotion had tired him, but presently resumed: "I
      wouldn't use your money, but this wasn't altogether because I was too
      proud to let you help. I wanted to keep you safe; farming's a risky
      business, and I couldn't play a niggardly, cautious game. There was the
      land, waiting to be worked; I couldn't spare labor or money. But since
      both might be lost, I was afraid to use your fortune as a stake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand," said Helen. "All the same, I would have been glad to take
      the risk. I don't think I'm very much afraid of hardship&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing smiled. "You have pluck, but don't know the strain that the wives
      of the struggling farmers have to bear. My object is to see that you don't
      know. But there's another thing, harder to explain; you felt that I
      neglected you, and I fear I did!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You didn't mean to neglect me. Perhaps I was foolish, Stephen, but I felt
      you left me out. There were ways I could have helped."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I took the wrong line; that's plain now, but we must think of the future
      and not make the same mistake. You are first with me, Helen, but I must
      work; it's all I'm fit for. I can't play games and am not an amusing
      talker&mdash;though I'm talking at large to-night. Well, we have made our
      home on the prairie, and all round us the best wheat-soil in the world is
      lying waste. They're getting short of food in Europe, America will soon
      use all she grows, and folks in the older countries fix their eyes on us.
      Then we have room for an industrious population on our wide plains, cities
      are waiting to spring up, a new nation is being born. I and the others who
      were given the land must clear the way. It's our business, our only
      justification for being there. Sounds romantic and exaggerated, but I
      think it's true!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true," said Helen. "Your views are larger than mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Festing, smiling. "I don't often let myself go and look far
      ahead. It's my share to tackle the job before my eyes; to drive the
      tractor plow, and the grading scoop along the road reserve. For all that,
      it's not a vague sense of duty that really drives me on; I must work, I'm
      unhappy when I stop! I'm afraid I'll always feel like that. what are we
      going to do about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must let me help more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I need help; that's something I have learned, and nobody can help like
      you. But the strain will slacken soon. The things that will make life
      easier for you are coming fast; branch railroads, telephones, busy little
      towns, neighbors, and social amusements. Much that you enjoyed in England
      will surround you on the plains. But it will not come as a gift, as it did
      at home; we will have worked for and made it possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen got up. Her color was higher than usual and her eyes sparkled. She
      was romantic and Festing had struck the right note, with rude sincerity
      and unconscious power. She saw visions of the future and the dignity of
      the immediate task. In this wide, new country, man needed woman's help,
      and her part was as large as his. Like Sadie, and many another, she heard
      the call for Pioneers. Crossing the door she stood by Festing's bunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand it all, Stephen. We must be patient and allow for small
      differences in our points of view, for I think, in the main, we see
      together. You must never leave me out again; I want to do my part."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing said nothing, but he pressed her hand and she kissed him.

      CHAPTER XXXI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      CHARNOCK'S TRIUMPH
    </h3>
    <p>
      Six weeks after the accident Musgrave and Charnock came into the shack one
      evening. The former had examined Festing in the afternoon, and Helen gave
      him a meaning look. It hinted that she had expected his visit and meant to
      encourage him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come near the stove and smoke if you like. It is very cold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No sign of the frost's breaking, I suppose?" said Festing, who lay
      propped up with pillows. "Did you get the particulars I asked for, Bob?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charnock gave him a paper with some calculations, and after a time he
      nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the whole, this is satisfactory; things are going better than I
      thought. But what about the new job across the river?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Things are going better than he thought! Isn't that like Stephen?"
      Charnock remarked to the others, and then turned to Festing. "However, I
      expect you didn't mean to be rude and you never were very tactful. We
      haven't begun the job you mentioned, but I don't know that it matters
      since we're busy at something else, and that's not what I want to talk
      about. Musgrave has examined you and gives us an encouraging report."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My opinion is that he can be moved and the journey home won't hurt him if
      proper care is used."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I don't want to be moved just yet," Festing objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt," said Musgrave dryly. "You are an obstinate fellow, but you're
      in our hands now, and we have to think what is best for you. To begin
      with, you won't be able to get about in time to be of much use, and you
      don't get better as fast as you ought. Then I understood you were resigned
      to going home before the contract is finished."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I must; but I don't want to go now. I'm able to arrange things with
      Charnock in the evenings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fact is he doesn't trust me yet," Charnock remarked with a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know that isn't true, Bob!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then prove you trust me by going home with Helen. She has been plucky to
      stay so long, and now you're fit to be moved, you oughtn't to keep her.
      There's another thing; to be frank, you don't help much. We need a boss to
      superintend, which you can't do, and when I want advice I can go to
      Norton. As a matter of fact, when I come here in the evenings you find
      fault with what I've done. When I undertake a job I like to feel I'm
      carrying it out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing stopped him and looked at Helen, for he was not deceived by
      Charnock's injured tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I imagine this is something like a plot to get me away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you would get better much faster at home, Stephen. You cannot do
      anything useful here, and you cannot rest. Mr. Musgrave agrees."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. If he stays, Festing will do himself harm and bother his
      partner."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing knitted his brows and was silent for a moment or two. Then he
      said, "Since it looks as if you had made your plans, I had better go.
      You're a very good fellow, Bob; but if you can't keep things straight,
      I'll come back and superintend from a stretcher."
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked about other matters, but when Charnock left, Helen put on her
      furs and told Festing she wanted fresh air. Moonlight shone upon the dark
      pines and sparkled on the snow, and when they came out of the shadow of
      the trees she thought Charnock's face was grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm grateful, Bob," she said. "It's a big thing you have undertaken!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I frankly wish it was smaller," Charnock answered. "I fact, I feel I have
      been horribly rash. I haven't Stephen's constructive talent or, for that
      matter, his energy, but somehow I mustn't be beaten."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen gave him a gentle look. "You won't be beaten. It's unthinkable! We
      trust you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she went back and read a newspaper to Festing, who was carried down
      to the supply train next day and made comfortable in the caboose. Charnock
      talked to him carelessly until the couplings tightened and the locomotive
      began to snort, but his mouth was firm and his face set as he went back to
      his work. He knew what he was up against, and there were difficulties he
      had not told Festing about.
    </p>
    <p>
      The days got longer, and the frost was relaxing its grip on the white
      prairie, when Festing left his homestead and walked to the trail-fork to
      meet the mail-carrier. He returned with some letters and sat down limply.
      His face was thin and pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I get tired soon, and there's nothing from Bob yet," he grumbled as he
      turned over the envelopes. "It's curious, because he told us the job was
      nearly finished and some of the big engineers were coming out to examine
      the track. They ought to have arrived some days ago, and I've no doubt
      they'd test the work thoroughly when they were there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You get too anxious," Helen replied. "If you had a calmer temperament,
      you would be stronger now. The engineers can hardly have had time to make
      a proper test."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have some grounds for being anxious. If the fellows aren't satisfied,
      we won't get paid."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen smiled. "You're really afraid that Bob may have been careless and
      neglected something!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bob's a very good partner; I've confessed that I misjudged him," Festing
      answered with a touch of embarrassment. "Still, you see, I know his
      drawbacks, and I know mine. There were two or three pieces of work, done
      before I left, that I now see might have been better planned."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen went to the door, for she heard a soft drumming of hoofs on beaten
      snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sadie's coming," she said. "Perhaps she has some news."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing followed her and Sadie stopped the horses, but did not get down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've a telegram from Bob; he'll be home to-morrow," she said. "He wants
      you both to meet him at the station."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he say anything about the job being finished?" Festing asked as he
      went down the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Sadie. "He seemed particularly anxious to see you at the depot;
      my hands are too numb or I'd show you the telegram. I haven't time to come
      in and don't want the team to stand in the cold."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she waved her hand to Helen and drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      About six o'clock next evening Helen and Festing walked up and down beside
      the track at the railroad settlement. There was no platform, but the
      agent's office stood near the rails, with a baggage shed, and a big tank
      for filtering saline water near the locomotive pipe. Behind these, three
      tall grain-elevators, which had not been finished when Festing saw them
      last, rose against the sky, dwarfing the skeleton frame of a new hotel.
      The ugly wooden houses had extended some distance across the snow, and
      Festing knew the significance of this. It was not dark yet, but the
      headlamp of a locomotive in the side-track flung a glittering beam a
      quarter of a mile down the line. In the west, a belt of saffron light, cut
      by the black smear of a bluff, glimmered on the horizon. Festing indicated
      the settlement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has grown fast, but if things go as some of us expect, the change will
      soon be magical. In a year or two you'll see a post-office like a palace,
      and probably an opera-house, besides street cars running north and south
      from the track."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I should like that," Helen remarked. "When it comes, you will
      have an office and a telephone, and be satisfied to superintend."
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing laughed. "It's possible, but there's much to be done first, and
      I'm not getting on very fast just now. Still I don't feel knocked out and
      I've walked half a mile."
    </p>
    <p>
      Glancing at the elevator towers and blocks of square-fronted houses that
      rose abruptly from the snow, Helen mused. The settlement jarred her
      fastidious taste, but she had seen Western towns that had, in a few years,
      grown out of their raw ugliness and blossomed in an efflorescence of
      ambitious architecture. Such beauty as they then possessed was not refined
      or subdued, but it was somehow characteristic of the country and
      harmonized with the builders' optimism. There was no permanence on the
      prairie; everything was in a fluid state of change and marked by a bold,
      but sometime misguided, striving for something better. Then she turned to
      her husband. His face was thin and she noted lines that came from mental
      strain and physical suffering, but his eyes were calm. She liked his look
      of quiet resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are getting stronger fast," she said. "The days are lengthening,
      spring is near, and you will soon be able to work again. Well, I will not
      try to stop you. When the prairie is plowed and covered with wheat I want
      you to feel that you have done your part. The change that is coming will
      bring the things women like; comfort, amusements, society. But what about
      you and the others, the pioneers, when there is no more ground to be
      broken and the way is cleared?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing smiled. "As a rule, the pioneer sells his homestead and goes on
      into the wilds to blaze another trail, but I imagine I shall be glad to
      rest. If not, we're an adaptable people and there are different ways of
      helping things along. One can learn to use other tools than the ax and
      plow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Helen, "You are getting broader. You see clearly, Stephen, and
      your views are often long, but I sometimes thought you focused them too
      narrowly on the object in front. Perhaps I shall have done something if I
      have taught you to look all round. But here's Sadie and the train."
    </p>
    <p>
      A light sprang out from the distant bluff and grew into a dazzling
      fan-shaped beam. Then the roar of wheels slackened, and Sadie joined the
      others as a bell began to toll, and with smoke streaming back along the
      cars the train rolled into the station. Somebody leaned out from the rails
      of a vestibule, and Sadie began to run beside the track.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come along!" she cried. "It's Bob!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Festing and Helen followed, and when they reached the vestibule Charnock
      pushed a door open and took them inside. The car was brightly lighted, but
      not furnished on the usual plan. A table stood in the middle, the
      curtained berths were at one end, and there were cases holding books and
      surveying instruments. It was obviously meant for the use of railroad
      managers and engineers, and three or four gentlemen stood near the table,
      as if they had just got up. Festing saw that one was Dalton, who advanced
      eagerly as Helen came in. He presented his companions to her and Sadie,
      and a gentleman who was well known on Canadian railroads gave Festing his
      hand. Another was Norton's employer, a famous contractor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down," said the first. "The engineer wants to fill his tank, and they
      won't pull out until we are ready." Then he turned to Festing. "We have
      examined a piece of tract you helped build and I must compliment you on a
      first-class job. As a rule, we are glad to get our contract work up to
      specification, but you have done better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My partner is really responsible for that," Festing replied. "I got
      knocked out soon after we made a good start and had to leave him to carry
      on."
    </p>
    <p>
      The contractor smiled as he interposed: "A good beginning counts for much,
      and I'm glad to state that Mr. Charnock has kept to your lines. When you
      were forced to leave it seemed prudent to make some inquiries, but we
      found that your partner was doing high-grade work, and now we have
      inspected it, I must admit that Norton's favorable reports were deserved."
      He paused and turned to Sadie. "If your husband's as good a farmer as an
      engineer, he'll make progress."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie flushed with pride. "Looks as if he'd made some already, but you
      didn't run much risk when you trusted him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My wife's the farmer and my partner the engineer," Charnock remarked. "I
      know my limits, but try to keep going when somebody starts me well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have gone farther than our bargain demanded, which doesn't often
      happen," said the contractor, who turned to Festing. "Mr. Charnock has my
      cheque for the main job, but there are some accounts to make up and you
      won't find my cashier disputes the extras. Perhaps that's all I need say,
      except that you have satisfied me, and, I gather, satisfied your men. In
      fact, you and Mr. Charnock leave us with general good feeling."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they talked about something else until a man came in to say that the
      locomotive tank was filled, and the engineer and contractor went to the
      vestibule with their guests. For a minute or two the group stood on the
      platform, exchanging farewell compliments, while the station agent waited
      in the snow. Then the engineer said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wanted to meet your husband, Mrs. Festing, and if we have any more
      difficult work, hope you will let me have him again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He came back the worse last time," Helen answered smiling. "I'm not sure
      I would have the courage to let him go. Besides, he has other work at
      home. A farm makes many demands on one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no doubt it does," agreed the engineer. "One imagines that on the
      Festing farm all demands will be met."
    </p>
    <p>
      He signed to the agent, the others went down the steps, and the bell began
      to toll as the lighted cars rolled by. The rattle of wheels got louder,
      and a plume of smoke trailed back and spread in a dingy cloud, but Helen
      and Festing stood, a little way from the others, watching the receding
      train. They felt that something was finished; satisfactorily finished
      amidst well-earned praise, but done with for good. Festing looked at Helen
      with a comprehending smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You answered right; I'm not going back! Our work is waiting, here on the
      plains."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Helen softly, "how much easier you make it when you call it
      ours!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They went to the hotel where they had left the team, and as the others
      followed Sadie turned to her husband with a glow of happy pride. He had
      come back, so to speak, triumphant, the guest of famous men who had said
      flattering things about him, and for his sake the train had been held up
      while the great contractor talked to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bob," she said, "you have made good! I can't tell you all I feel about
      it. Some day you'll be a famous man."
    </p>
    <p>

public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
